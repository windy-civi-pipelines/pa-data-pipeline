Section 2 of the act of May 28, 1937 (P.L.955, 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728 No.265), known as the Housing Authorities Law, is amended to read:Section 2. Findings and Declaration of Policy.--It has been determined by the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, and it is hereby declared as a matter of legislative finding that--(a) There exists in urban and rural communities, within the various counties of this Commonwealth, numerous slums and unsafe, unsanitary, inadequate or overcrowded dwellings, which conditions are accompanied and aggravated by an acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings within the financial reach of persons of low income and persons of moderate income, such conditions arising from overcrowding, dilapidation, faulty construction, obsolete buildings, lack of proper light, air, and sanitary facilities.(b) The existence of any of the above enumerated conditions is prejudicial to the welfare of the people of this Commonwealth because such conditions--(1) encourage the spread of disease and impair public health and morals; (2) increase the hazards of fires, accidents, and other calamities which result in loss of life and property; (3) subject the moral standards of the people to bad influences which have permanent deleterious social effects; (4) increase the violation of the criminal laws of the Commonwealth so as to jeopardize the safety and well-being of the inhabitants thereof; (5) necessitate the expenditure of vast sums of public money, both by the Commonwealth and local governmental bodies, for the purpose of crime prevention, punishment, and correction, fire and accident prevention, public health service and relief.(c) The failure to remedy the acute dwelling shortage is directly related to the stagnation of business activity in the 20250HB1293PN1473 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 construction, durable goods, and allied industries which are conducted within this Commonwealth, and the stagnation of which has produced serious and prolonged unemployment, with all its injurious effects upon the welfare of the inhabitants of this Commonwealth.(d) Private industry alone has been and now is unable to overcome the obstacles which have prevented and are now preventing it from clearing slum areas and relieving the shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income and persons of moderate income, and the construction, pursuant to this act, of housing projects for persons of low income and persons of moderate income would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise.Therefore, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to promote the health and welfare of the inhabitants thereof by the creation of corporate and politic bodies to be known as housing authorities. The public purposes for which such authorities shall operate shall be--(1) the clearance, replanning, and reconstruction of the areas in which slums exist; (2) the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income and persons of moderate income through new construction or the reconstruction, restoration, reconditioning, remodeling or repair of existing structures, so as to prevent recurrence of the economically and socially disastrous conditions hereinbefore described; and (3) the accomplishment of a combination of the foregoing. Such purposes are hereby declared to be public uses for which public money may be spent, and private property acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.Section 2. Section 3(j) and (l.1) of the act are amended and 20250HB1293PN1473 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 the section is amended by adding a subsection to read:Section 3.

Formation of Housing Authorities.--* * *(d) The governing body of any city or county or the Governor, as the case may be, shall declare that there is need for a housing authority to function within such city or county if and only if the said governing body or the Governor shall find, either that--(1) unsanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations exist in said city or county; or that (2) there is a lack of sufficient, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations in said city or county available to persons of low income or persons of moderate income, and that this results in any of the conditions described in section two (b) and (c) of this act. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or unsanitary, said governing body or the Governor, as the case may be, shall take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air space, and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the 20250HB1293PN1473 - 5 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 sanitary facilities, and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings, which endanger life, health or property by fire, disease or other causes.* * *Section 10.

It shall not accept any person as a tenant in any housing project if the person or persons, who would occupy the dwelling, have an aggregate annual income in excess of six times the annual rental of the quarters to be furnished such person or persons. In computing rental for the purpose of selecting tenants, there shall be included in the rental the average annual cost, as determined by the Authority, to the occupants of heat, water, electricity, gas, cooking range, and other necessary services or facilities, whether or not the charge for such services and facilities is in fact included in the rental.
