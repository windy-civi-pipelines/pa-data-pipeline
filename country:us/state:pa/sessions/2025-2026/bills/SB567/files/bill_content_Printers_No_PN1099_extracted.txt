Legislative findings and purpose.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) The Uniformity Clause of the Constitution of Pennsylvania requires that all taxes, including property taxes, be uniform within the territory of the taxing jurisdiction.(2) Political subdivisions in this Commonwealth levy taxes on real property according to a base year assessment that is not subject to any statutory requirement to conduct a countywide revision of assessment on a recurrent regular or needs basis.(3) The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held that the base year system of taxation has been rendered unconstitutional as applied where the prolonged and potentially indefinite use of an outdated base year assessment becomes stale, and thus violates the Uniformity Clause.(4) The Supreme Court determined that Pennsylvania is 20250SB0567PN1099 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 the only state in the United States that allows the indefinite use of a base year by statute.(5) Numerous Pennsylvania courts, having found that an in-use base year assessment was unconstitutional as applied, have repeatedly ordered counties to conduct countywide revisions of assessment.(6) The Supreme Court has articulated that the General Assembly is the appropriate place to fashion a more comprehensive and soundly constitutional scheme.(7) Counties can facilitate a more uniform system of taxation on property by performing regular countywide revisions of assessment on all property on a regular and recurrent basis.§ 88A03. Definitions.The following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:"Coefficient of dispersion."

Definitions.88A04. Regular cyclical revision of assessment.88A05. Schedule of cyclical revision of assessment.88A06. Funding cyclical revision of assessment.88A07. Noncompliance.§ 88A01.

Legislative findings and purpose.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) The Uniformity Clause of the Constitution of Pennsylvania requires that all taxes, including property taxes, be uniform within the territory of the taxing jurisdiction.(2) Political subdivisions in this Commonwealth levy taxes on real property according to a base year assessment that is not subject to any statutory requirement to conduct a countywide revision of assessment on a recurrent regular or needs basis.(3) The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held that the base year system of taxation has been rendered unconstitutional as applied where the prolonged and potentially indefinite use of an outdated base year assessment becomes stale, and thus violates the Uniformity Clause.(4) The Supreme Court determined that Pennsylvania is 20250SB0567PN1099 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 the only state in the United States that allows the indefinite use of a base year by statute.(5) Numerous Pennsylvania courts, having found that an in-use base year assessment was unconstitutional as applied, have repeatedly ordered counties to conduct countywide revisions of assessment.(6) The Supreme Court has articulated that the General Assembly is the appropriate place to fashion a more comprehensive and soundly constitutional scheme.(7) Counties can facilitate a more uniform system of taxation on property by performing regular countywide revisions of assessment on all property on a regular and recurrent basis.§ 88A03. Definitions.The following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:"Coefficient of dispersion."
