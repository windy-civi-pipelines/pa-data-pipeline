In each energy year thereafter, each selected nuclear power plant shall receive a number of ZECs equal to the number of megawatt hours of electricity that it produced in that energy year.(h) Eligibility periods.--(1) Selected nuclear power plants shall initially receive ZECs for an eligibility period that shall run through the end of the first energy year in which the nuclear power plant is selected, plus an additional three energy years.(2) No later than 13 months prior to the conclusion of the initial eligibility period established under paragraph (1), and no later than 13 months prior to the conclusion of each three energy year eligibility period thereafter, a nuclear power plant may demonstrate its eligibility to the commission and the commission may certify the nuclear power plant's eligibility to receive ZECs for additional eligibility periods of three energy years, consistent with the provisions of this section.(3) A selected nuclear power plant shall annually certify to the commission that the nuclear power plant will continue operations at full or near full capacity for the duration of the period of its eligibility to receive ZECs, except with respect to nuclear power plant shutdowns for necessary maintenance and refueling.(i) Price and purchase of ZECs by electric distribution companies.--(1) The commission shall determine the price of a ZEC each energy year by dividing the total number of dollars held 20250SB0372PN0320 - 27 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 by electric public utilities in the accounts established under subsection (j)(1) at the end of the prior energy year by the greater of:(i) 40% of the total number of megawatt hours of electricity distributed by the electric public utilities in this Commonwealth in the prior energy year; or(ii) the number of megawatt hours of electricity generated in the prior energy year by the selected nuclear power plants.(2) Each electric distribution company in this Commonwealth shall be required to begin to purchase ZECs on a monthly basis from each selected nuclear power plant with payment to follow within 90 days after the conclusion of the first energy year in which selected nuclear power plants receive ZECs and within 90 days after the conclusion of each subsequent energy year. The number of ZECs an electric distribution company shall be required to purchase shall equal the total number of ZECs received by the selected nuclear power plants for the prior energy year under subsection (g) multiplied by the percentage of electricity distributed in this Commonwealth by the electric distribution company as compared to other electric public utilities in this Commonwealth.(3) To ensure that a selected nuclear power plant does not receive double-payment for its fuel diversity, resilience, air quality or other environmental attributes, the commission shall annually determine the dollar amount received by the selected nuclear power plant in an energy year under a Federal law, rule, regulation, order, tariff or other action, or a law, rule, regulation, order, tariff or 20250SB0372PN0320 - 28 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 other action of this Commonwealth or any other state, or a regional compact referenced in subsection (e)(4). Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the number of ZECs purchased by each electric distribution company from a selected nuclear power plant for an energy year shall be reduced by the number of ZECs equal in value to the dollar amount determined by the commission in this paragraph, multiplied by the percentage of electricity distributed in this Commonwealth by the electric distribution company as compared to other electric public utilities in this Commonwealth. To the extent that the commission determines that a selected nuclear plant receives revenues for its fuel diversity, resilience, air quality or other environmental attributes, the commission shall immediately reduce the number of ZECs on a prospective basis consistent with the level of the revenues.(i.1) ZEC Fund.--The ZEC Fund is established as a separate fund in the State Treasury. Money in the ZEC Fund is appropriated to the commission on a continuing basis for the purpose of implementing the ZEC program. All money received by the commission under this section shall be deposited into the ZEC Fund.(j) Recovery of costs.--(1) The commission shall order the full recovery of all costs associated with the electric distribution company's required procurement of ZECs, and with the commission's implementation of the ZEC program, through a nonbypassable, irrevocable charge imposed on the electric distribution company's retail distribution customers. Within 150 days after the effective date of this paragraph, each electric distribution company shall file with the commission a tariff 20250SB0372PN0320 - 29 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 to recover from the electric distribution company's retail distribution customers as follows:(i) For an electric distribution company whose rates are regulated by the commission, the commission shall determine the appropriate charges for the electric distribution company's tariff that permit recovery of the incremental cost of compliance subject to the retail rate impact limits provided under subparagraph (2).(ii) An electric distribution company shall recover the incremental cost of compliance with the renewable energy standards. An electric distribution company may not comply with the renewable energy standards to the extent that, as determined by the commission, recovery of the incremental cost of compliance will have a retail rate impact that exceeds any of the following:(A) $3.00 per month per residential customer meter.(B) $16.58 per month per commercial secondary customer meter.(C) $187.50 per month per commercial primary or industrial customer meter.(2) Within 60 days after the tariff filing under paragraph (1), after notice, the opportunity for comment and public hearing, the commission shall approve the tariff, provided that the tariff is consistent with the provisions of this subsection. No later than the date of the commission's order establishing the initial selected nuclear power plants to receive ZECs, each electric distribution company shall implement the tariff and begin collecting from its retail distribution customers the approved charge.
