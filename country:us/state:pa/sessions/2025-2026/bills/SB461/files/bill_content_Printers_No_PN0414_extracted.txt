2025-2026 Regular Session SB 461 PN 0414 Bill Text (HTM) See other bills under thesame topic PRINTER'S NO. 414 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIASENATE BILL No.461 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY BROOKS, COLLETT, FONTANA, SANTARSIERO, LANGERHOLC, CULVER, COSTA, COMITTA, KANE, J. WARD AND L. WILLIAMS, MARCH 17, 2025 REFERRED TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, MARCH 17, 2025 AN ACTProviding for patient access to diagnostics and treatments for Lyme disease and related tick-borne illnesses; and requiring health care policies to provide certain coverage.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Lyme Disease and Related Tick-Borne Illness Diagnosis and Treatment Act.Section 2. Legislative findings.The General Assembly finds as follows:(1) This Commonwealth has the highest incidence of Lyme disease in the country in 10 of the past 11 years. Each year, approximately 100,000 Pennsylvanians get Lyme disease.(2) In 2018, there were 102,080 confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases reported in this Commonwealth, which represents 30.32% of all cases in the United States. This is an incidence rate of 70.3 per 100,000 confirmed and probable cases in 2019.123456789101112131415161718 (3) From 2010 to 2019, there have been more than 66,144 confirmed Lyme disease cases in this Commonwealth, but due to the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's number only represents confirmed cases, the estimated number of Lyme disease cases are 661,440 based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 10 times multiplier of actual cases. Therefore, with more than 12,960,000 Pennsylvanians in 2019, an estimated 5.1% of Pennsylvanians contracted Lyme disease in the same 10 years.(4) In July 2021, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Physician General discussed the high incidence in this Commonwealth resulting in high prevalence of ticks and confirmed a high risk of Lyme disease in every county of this Commonwealth. The Department of Environmental Protection collected two times more blacklegged tick nymphs in 2021 compared to 2020 and stated that infected blacklegged ticks are present in all 67 counties in this Commonwealth.(5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States.(6) The early clinical diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these related tick-borne illnesses can greatly reduce the risks of continued, diverse and chronic symptoms that can affect every system and organ of the human body and often every aspect of an individual's life.(7) Between 10% to 40% of Lyme disease patients may go on to suffer from complex, chronic/persistent conditions which may be more difficult to treat.(8) There are multiple diagnostic and treatment 20250SB0461PN0414 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease and related tick-borne illness.(9) Scientific understanding of these complex related tick-borne illnesses is expected to evolve rapidly in the next decade, including prevention, diagnosis and treatment options.(10) A 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that only 39% of individuals with Lyme disease were treated using short-term antibiotics. The majority of the individuals were treated for longer periods.(11) In 2014, the Massachusetts Center for Health and Information Analysis found little to no increase in insurance costs as a result of expanding coverage to include longer-term courses of antibiotics. The expansion by fully insured health plans was projected to result in an average annual increase, over five years, to the typical member's monthly health insurance premiums of between a negligible amount and 13¢ per year.Section 3. Legislative purpose.The purposes of this act are:(1) To promote the education and awareness of Lyme disease and related tick-borne illnesses among health care practitioners.(2) To substantially reduce the incidence of related tick-borne illnesses by providing insurance coverage for diagnostic testing and treatment.(3) To eliminate or, at the very least, significantly reduce the number of confirmed Lyme disease cases and related tick-borne illnesses in this Commonwealth.(4) To promote the availability of tick testing to aid 20250SB0461PN0414 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 in determining a clinical diagnosis.(5) To promote the availability of diagnostic testing and antibiotic therapies for patients by licensed health care practitioners.(6) To improve public awareness of Lyme disease and related tick-borne illnesses and educate the public about tick bite prevention practices that can reduce the incidence and prevalence of ticks in this Commonwealth.Section 4.
