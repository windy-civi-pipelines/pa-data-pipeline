Effective date.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act.Section 2. Legislative declaration.The General Assembly hereby declares as follows:(1) It is a basic right of all employees to work in an environment that is free from hazards and risks to their safety. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that this right is also afforded to employees of the Commonwealth, its counties, cities, towns, boroughs and townships and other public employers who serve the people of this Commonwealth.(2) A significant percentage of all of those employed in 20250HB0308PN1303 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 this Commonwealth are employed by the Commonwealth or by one of its political subdivisions. Many of these public employees perform job functions comparable to those performed by workers in the private sector who are protected by 29 U.S.C. Ch. 15 (relating to occupational safety and health). The General Assembly, therefore, finds it inappropriate to continue two standards for employee safety, one applicable to those who work in the private sector and one for those who are employed by a public employer.(3) The General Assembly has further determined that a safe place in which to work is economically advantageous to employers. Work-related accidents and injuries and the absences caused thereby decrease employee productivity and increase workers' compensation costs. In addition, unsafe premises increase the risk of financial liability for injuries to members of the public who frequent public buildings.(4) The General Assembly, in an exercise of the Commonwealth's police power, charges the secretary with the responsibility to ensure that all public employees are afforded the same safeguards in their workplace as are granted to employees in the private sector.Section 3.

Reports to United States Secretary of Labor.Section 22. Confidentiality of information maintained.Section 23. Funding.Section 24. Effective date.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act.Section 2. Legislative declaration.The General Assembly hereby declares as follows:(1) It is a basic right of all employees to work in an environment that is free from hazards and risks to their safety. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that this right is also afforded to employees of the Commonwealth, its counties, cities, towns, boroughs and townships and other public employers who serve the people of this Commonwealth.(2) A significant percentage of all of those employed in 20250HB0308PN1303 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 this Commonwealth are employed by the Commonwealth or by one of its political subdivisions. Many of these public employees perform job functions comparable to those performed by workers in the private sector who are protected by 29 U.S.C. Ch. 15 (relating to occupational safety and health). The General Assembly, therefore, finds it inappropriate to continue two standards for employee safety, one applicable to those who work in the private sector and one for those who are employed by a public employer.(3) The General Assembly has further determined that a safe place in which to work is economically advantageous to employers. Work-related accidents and injuries and the absences caused thereby decrease employee productivity and increase workers' compensation costs. In addition, unsafe premises increase the risk of financial liability for injuries to members of the public who frequent public buildings.(4) The General Assembly, in an exercise of the Commonwealth's police power, charges the secretary with the responsibility to ensure that all public employees are afforded the same safeguards in their workplace as are granted to employees in the private sector.Section 3.

An individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal representative or an organized group of any of them."Public employee" or "employee." An individual employed by a public employer."Public employer" or "employer."
