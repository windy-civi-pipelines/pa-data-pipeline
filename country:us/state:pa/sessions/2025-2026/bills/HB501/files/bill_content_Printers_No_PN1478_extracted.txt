If, after notice and hearing, the commission determines that an electric distribution company or electric generation supplier has failed to comply with subsections (b), [and] (c) and (c.1), the commission shall impose an alternative compliance payment on that company or supplier.(3) [The] (i) Through May 31, 2027, the alternative compliance payment, with the exception of the solar photovoltaic share compliance requirement [set forth] 20250HB0501PN1478 - 33 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 specified in subsection (b)(2), shall be $45 times the number of additional [alternative] reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (b) or (c).(ii) Subject to subparagraph (iii), beginning June 1, 2027, and continuing each year thereafter, the alternative compliance payment, with the exception of the solar photovoltaic share compliance requirement specified in subsection (b)(2), shall be $45 times the number of additional reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (b). The alternative compliance payment shall be $35 times the number of reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (c). The alternative compliance payment shall be $15 times the number of reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (c.1).(iii) Beginning June 1, 2030, and continuing each year thereafter, the commission shall adjust the alternative compliance payment amount applicable in any tier under this paragraph by the percentage difference between the energy price index on June 1 of the prior year and the current value of the energy price index.(4) The alternative compliance payment for the solar photovoltaic share shall be 200% of the average market value of solar renewable energy credits sold during the reporting period within the service region of the regional transmission organization, including, where applicable, the levelized up-front rebates received by sellers of solar renewable energy credits in other jurisdictions in the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. transmission organization (PJM) or its successor.20250HB0501PN1478 - 34 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (5) The commission shall establish a process to provide for, at least annually, a review of the [alternative] PRESS energy market within this Commonwealth and the service territories of the regional transmission organizations that manage the transmission system in any part of this Commonwealth. The commission will use the results of this study to identify any needed changes to the cost associated with the alternative compliance payment program. If the commission finds that the costs associated with the alternative compliance payment program must be changed, the commission shall present these findings to the General Assembly for legislative enactment.(g) Transfer to sustainable development funds.--(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of 66 Pa.C.S. §§ 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees) and 3315 (relating to disposition of fines and penalties), alternative compliance payments imposed pursuant to this act shall be paid into Pennsylvania's Sustainable Energy Funds created under the commission's restructuring orders under 66 Pa.C.S.

If, after notice and hearing, the commission determines that an electric distribution company or electric generation supplier has failed to comply with subsections (b), [and] (c) and (c.1), the commission shall impose an alternative compliance payment on that company or supplier.(3) [The] (i) Through May 31, 2027, the alternative compliance payment, with the exception of the solar photovoltaic share compliance requirement [set forth] 20250HB0501PN1478 - 33 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 specified in subsection (b)(2), shall be $45 times the number of additional [alternative] reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (b) or (c).(ii) Subject to subparagraph (iii), beginning June 1, 2027, and continuing each year thereafter, the alternative compliance payment, with the exception of the solar photovoltaic share compliance requirement specified in subsection (b)(2), shall be $45 times the number of additional reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (b). The alternative compliance payment shall be $35 times the number of reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (c). The alternative compliance payment shall be $15 times the number of reliable energy credits needed in order to comply with subsection (c.1).(iii) Beginning June 1, 2030, and continuing each year thereafter, the commission shall adjust the alternative compliance payment amount applicable in any tier under this paragraph by the percentage difference between the energy price index on June 1 of the prior year and the current value of the energy price index.(4) The alternative compliance payment for the solar photovoltaic share shall be 200% of the average market value of solar renewable energy credits sold during the reporting period within the service region of the regional transmission organization, including, where applicable, the levelized up-front rebates received by sellers of solar renewable energy credits in other jurisdictions in the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. transmission organization (PJM) or its successor.20250HB0501PN1478 - 34 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (5) The commission shall establish a process to provide for, at least annually, a review of the [alternative] PRESS energy market within this Commonwealth and the service territories of the regional transmission organizations that manage the transmission system in any part of this Commonwealth. The commission will use the results of this study to identify any needed changes to the cost associated with the alternative compliance payment program. If the commission finds that the costs associated with the alternative compliance payment program must be changed, the commission shall present these findings to the General Assembly for legislative enactment.(g) Transfer to sustainable development funds.--(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of 66 Pa.C.S. §§ 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees) and 3315 (relating to disposition of fines and penalties), alternative compliance payments imposed pursuant to this act shall be paid into Pennsylvania's Sustainable Energy Funds created under the commission's restructuring orders under 66 Pa.C.S.
