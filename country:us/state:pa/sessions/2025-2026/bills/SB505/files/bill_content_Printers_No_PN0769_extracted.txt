The effective life of any individual measure included in such a plan may exceed 15 years.(iv) Measures and programs that result in reductions in energy consumption for households at or below 150% of the Federal poverty income guidelines, or the alternative income level established by the commission under subsection (b)(1)(i)(G), shall, with respect to those reductions and for the exclusive purpose of the cost-benefit evaluation of that specific measure or program under this subsection, multiply the calculation of benefits by two. The multiplication shall not be undertaken for the purposes of calculating reductions in consumption under subsection (b)(1)(i)(G) or the financial incentive in subsection (k.1)(1)(ii).(d) Peak demand.--The plans adopted under subsection (b) shall reduce [electric] energy demand as follows:(1) By May 31, 2013, the weather-normalized demand of the retail customers of each electric distribution company shall be reduced by a minimum of 4.5% of annual system peak demand in the 100 hours of highest demand. The reduction shall be measured against the electric distribution company's peak demand for June 1, 2007, through May 31, 2008.(2) By November 30, 2013, the commission shall compare the total costs of energy efficiency, resilience and conservation plans implemented under this section to the total savings in energy and capacity costs to retail customers in this Commonwealth or other costs determined by the commission.

Reductions in demand shall be measured from the electric distribution company's peak demand for the period from June 1, 2011, through May 31, 2012. The reductions in consumption required by the commission shall be accomplished no later than May 31, 2017.(3) By November 30, 2030, the commission shall compare the total costs of energy efficiency, resilience and conservation plans implemented under this section to the total savings in energy, resilience and capacity costs to retail customers in this Commonwealth or other costs determined by the commission. If the commission determines that the benefits of the plans exceed the costs, the commission shall set requirements for electric distribution companies to establish a program addressing daily peak demand or an alternative reduction program approved by the commission. The reductions in consumption required by the commission shall be accomplished no later than May 31, 2032.(e) Commission approval.--(1) The commission shall conduct a public hearing on each plan and allow for the submission of recommendations by the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate and by members of the public as to how the electric distribution company could improve its plan or exceed the required reductions in consumption under subsections (c) and (d).(2) The commission shall approve or disapprove a plan filed under subsection (b) within 120 days of submission.

The effective life of any individual measure included in such a plan may exceed 15 years.(iv) Measures and programs that result in reductions in energy consumption for households at or below 150% of the Federal poverty income guidelines, or the alternative income level established by the commission under subsection (b)(1)(i)(G), shall, with respect to those reductions and for the exclusive purpose of the cost-benefit evaluation of that specific measure or program under this subsection, multiply the calculation of benefits by two. The multiplication shall not be undertaken for the purposes of calculating reductions in consumption under subsection (b)(1)(i)(G) or the financial incentive in subsection (k.1)(1)(ii).(d) Peak demand.--The plans adopted under subsection (b) shall reduce [electric] energy demand as follows:(1) By May 31, 2013, the weather-normalized demand of the retail customers of each electric distribution company shall be reduced by a minimum of 4.5% of annual system peak demand in the 100 hours of highest demand. The reduction shall be measured against the electric distribution company's peak demand for June 1, 2007, through May 31, 2008.(2) By November 30, 2013, the commission shall compare the total costs of energy efficiency, resilience and conservation plans implemented under this section to the total savings in energy and capacity costs to retail customers in this Commonwealth or other costs determined by the commission.

Reductions in demand shall be measured from the electric distribution company's peak demand for the period from June 1, 2011, through May 31, 2012. The reductions in consumption required by the commission shall be accomplished no later than May 31, 2017.(3) By November 30, 2030, the commission shall compare the total costs of energy efficiency, resilience and conservation plans implemented under this section to the total savings in energy, resilience and capacity costs to retail customers in this Commonwealth or other costs determined by the commission. If the commission determines that the benefits of the plans exceed the costs, the commission shall set requirements for electric distribution companies to establish a program addressing daily peak demand or an alternative reduction program approved by the commission. The reductions in consumption required by the commission shall be accomplished no later than May 31, 2032.(e) Commission approval.--(1) The commission shall conduct a public hearing on each plan and allow for the submission of recommendations by the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate and by members of the public as to how the electric distribution company could improve its plan or exceed the required reductions in consumption under subsections (c) and (d).(2) The commission shall approve or disapprove a plan filed under subsection (b) within 120 days of submission.
