If the amount of tax, as assessed, shall be greater than the amount theretofore paid, the additional assessment shall be paid by the taxpayer to the department within ten days after a notice of the amount of such additional tax, as assessed, shall be mailed to the taxpayer by the department. In such case, if the return is made in good faith, and the understatement of the amount in the return is made in good faith, there shall be no interest or penalty because of such understatement, provided the deficiency be paid, or notice of an intention to file a petition for a reassessment, or to appear and be heard as herein provided, shall be given within ten days after notice of the amount is mailed to the taxpayer. If payment is not made within ten days, and if no notice of an intention to file a petition for a reassessment, or to appear and be heard is given to the department within ten days as herein provided, there shall be added to the amount of the deficiency five per centum thereof, and, in addition, interest at the rate of one per centum per month for each month or fraction thereof, from the date of such notice to the date of payment. If the understatement is false or fraudulent with intent to evade the tax, the tax, on the additional income, discovered to be taxable and assessed by the department shall be double, and an additional one per centum shall be added to the amount so due for each month or fraction of a month from the date the tax was originally due to the date of payment.C.

Estimated Assessments.--A. If any individual or fiduciary believed by the department to be liable for a tax under the provisions of this act shall have failed to file a return in accordance with, and within the time prescribed by, the provisions of this act, or any extension thereof granted by the department, if the department should deem it more conducive to the public interest because of the supposed smallness of the tax, or for any other reason, not to proceed to compel the exhibition of such individual's or fiduciary's accounts, it may make an estimated assessment of the probable amount of the tax owing by such individual or fiduciary; but, in every such case, it shall add to every such estimated assessment a penalty of fifty per centum, to include any losses which might otherwise accrue to the Commonwealth from such neglect or refusal to file a return or statement, and the department shall proceed to recover money so due the Commonwealth as in other cases, if not paid when due, as hereinafter provided.20250HB1815PN2235 - 28 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 B.
