The expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(5) If the Commonwealth does not proceed with the action and the qui tam plaintiff conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorney fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the qui tam plaintiff's legal claim was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.(f) Certain actions barred.--(1) A court does not have jurisdiction over an action filed under this section against the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, a cabinet member, a deputy secretary, a member of the General Assembly or a member of the judiciary if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Commonwealth when the action was brought.(2) The following shall apply:(i) Subject to subparagraph (ii), the court shall dismiss an action or legal claim brought under subsection (b) if substantially the same allegations or transactions alleged in the action or legal claim were publicly disclosed in:(A) the news media;(B) a criminal, civil or administrative hearing in which the Commonwealth is or was a party; or(C) a Federal, State or local legislative or other governmental report, hearing, audit or investigation.20250SB0038PN0341 - 14 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (ii) The court may not dismiss an action under subparagraph (i) if:(A) the action was brought by the Attorney General;(B) the Attorney General opposes dismissal; or(C) the qui tam plaintiff is an original source of the information publicly disclosed.(3) A person may not bring an action under this section which is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Commonwealth is already a party.(g) Commonwealth not liable for certain expenses.--The Commonwealth is not liable for expenses which a qui tam plaintiff incurs in bringing an action under this section.(h) Cooperation by agencies.--Commonwealth agencies shall cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of false claims under this section, whether the claims are brought by the Attorney General or a qui tam plaintiff.Section 1413-E.

The expenses, fees and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(5) If the Commonwealth does not proceed with the action and the qui tam plaintiff conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorney fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the qui tam plaintiff's legal claim was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.(f) Certain actions barred.--(1) A court does not have jurisdiction over an action filed under this section against the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, a cabinet member, a deputy secretary, a member of the General Assembly or a member of the judiciary if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Commonwealth when the action was brought.(2) The following shall apply:(i) Subject to subparagraph (ii), the court shall dismiss an action or legal claim brought under subsection (b) if substantially the same allegations or transactions alleged in the action or legal claim were publicly disclosed in:(A) the news media;(B) a criminal, civil or administrative hearing in which the Commonwealth is or was a party; or(C) a Federal, State or local legislative or other governmental report, hearing, audit or investigation.20250SB0038PN0341 - 14 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (ii) The court may not dismiss an action under subparagraph (i) if:(A) the action was brought by the Attorney General;(B) the Attorney General opposes dismissal; or(C) the qui tam plaintiff is an original source of the information publicly disclosed.(3) A person may not bring an action under this section which is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Commonwealth is already a party.(g) Commonwealth not liable for certain expenses.--The Commonwealth is not liable for expenses which a qui tam plaintiff incurs in bringing an action under this section.(h) Cooperation by agencies.--Commonwealth agencies shall cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of false claims under this section, whether the claims are brought by the Attorney General or a qui tam plaintiff.Section 1413-E.
