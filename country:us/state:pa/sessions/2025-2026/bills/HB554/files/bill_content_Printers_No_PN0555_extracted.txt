A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing Authority and each of the Member States' Licensing Authority.E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend 20250HB0554PN0555 - 35 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 beyond the effective date of termination.F.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.

If any Member State is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member States should be less than seven.2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 10(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.4.
