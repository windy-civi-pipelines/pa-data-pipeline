For each device deemed unsatisfactory, the county election board shall take steps to determine the cause of the error, shall attempt to identify and test other devices that could reasonably be expected to have the same error and shall test a number of additional devices sufficient to determine that each device is satisfactory.

The records shall be present and available for inspection and reference during public preelection testing by any individual in attendance during the testing.

Records of testing shall include, for each device, the name of each person who tested the 20250HB0154PN0114 - 7 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 device and the date, place, time and results of each test.
