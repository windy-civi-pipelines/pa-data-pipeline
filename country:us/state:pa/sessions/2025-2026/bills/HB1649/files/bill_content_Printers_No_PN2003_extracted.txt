2025-2026 Regular Session HB 1649 PN 2003 Bill Text (HTM) See other bills under thesame topic PRINTER'S NO. 2003 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIAHOUSE BILL No.1649 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY FINK, STAATS, BARGER, ZIMMERMAN, ROAE, COOK, ANDERSON AND RYNCAVAGE, JUNE 24, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, JUNE 24, 2025 AN ACTAmending Titles 53 (Municipalities Generally) and 72 (Taxation and Fiscal Affairs) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, eliminating school district property taxes; imposing county and school district taxes; establishing the School District Emergency Fund and the School District Property Tax Elimination Fund; consolidating Articles II and III of the Tax Reform Code of 1971; in preliminary provisions relating to sales and use tax, providing for definitions; in taxation generally relating to sales and use tax, providing for exclusions and for transfer to county sales and use tax accounts; in preliminary provisions relating to personal income tax, providing for definitions; and making repeals.This act may be referred to as the School Property Tax Elimination Act.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) School district property taxes are a fixed expense for property owners, which creates an unsustainable and regressive system of taxation impacting our fundamental rights of life, liberty and property. School district property taxes are not reflective of a property owner's ability to pay and are regressive in nature.(2) The current rate of increase of school district property taxes is unsustainable due to factors frequently 1234567891011121314151617181920212223 beyond the control of local school officials and school boards, including underfunded pensions, rapidly escalating health care costs, more complex educational requirements for students and unfunded mandates.(3) School district property taxes impact individuals differently. For example, if spouses are retired and one spouse passes away, the income reduction caused by the death is immediate, but the school district property tax burden remains unchanged. Other factors impacting older Pennsylvanians' ability to bear the burden of school district property taxes include the amount of financial assets in retirement, health, mobility and the proximity of family members. School district property taxes are problematic for working families as well, with young working families bearing the brunt of funding the State while managing such financial burdens as income taxes, exploding health care coverage costs and day care expenses.(4) This Commonwealth faces an additional risk through its tax structure and limited job creation, as young working families continue to relocate from this Commonwealth, partly as a result of Pennsylvania's tax system being specifically geared to taxation of income from working citizens, with retirement income not being taxed.(5) The Independent Fiscal Office reports that Pennsylvania is attracting more seniors as residents because of the tax status in this Commonwealth of retirement income, particularly when compared to neighboring states.(6) The demographic changes to this Commonwealth, fueled by the combination of the exodus of younger people from this Commonwealth and the migration of older people into this 20250HB1649PN2003 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Commonwealth, have precipitated a growing financial crisis.(7) School districts are fixed cost-intensive operations and seek stability in funding through property taxes, but the predictability and certainty of school district property taxes create contradictory impacts on property owners in meeting their tax obligations.(8) School district property tax reform must be accomplished in an equitable manner in the form of the total elimination of school district property taxes for residential and commercial properties. Businesses in this Commonwealth alone cannot and should not bear the financial burden caused by the elimination of school district property taxes on residential property only. (See 53 Pa.C.S. § 9011(a).)(9) School district property tax reform must also include rental properties, whereby each landlord must reduce rental payments required of each residential or commercial tenant in an amount equal to the reduction of taxes on real property attributable to a tenant's unit. (See 53 Pa.C.S. § 9017.)(10) This act provides for the elimination of school district property taxes through the following:(i) An increase in the sales, use and occupancy taxes, whereby a new or additional 2% tax shall be imposed on certain items and that money distributed to each county of this Commonwealth, which shall disburse money to school districts within the county from the School District Property Tax Elimination Fund. (See 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 90A Subchs. C and F.) For this purpose, certain exclusions from taxation are eliminated, including certain clothing, candy and gum. (See 53 20250HB1649PN2003 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Pa.C.S. § 90A22(b.1).)(ii) The imposition by each school district of a local tax on the personal income of resident taxpayers of the school district up to a maximum rate of 1.88%, the revenue from which shall be collected by and be solely for the use of school districts. (See 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 90A Subch. D.) For this purpose, compensation is expanded to include taxation of old age or retirement benefits, with the exception of Social Security benefits and other similar types of benefits enumerated under the definition of "compensation." (See the definition of "compensation" in 72 Pa.C.S. § 2102, which effectuates these changes.)(11) This act is not intended to reduce expenditures made to school districts in this Commonwealth. The purpose of this act is to shift a source of local school district funding away from school district property taxes in a manner that does not negatively impact school districts.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1.

Constitutional construction.In addition to the provisions relating to legislative intent under section 2203(i) (relating to classes of income), if a word, phrase, clause, sentence, section or provision of this subpart is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, the decision of the court shall not affect or impair any of the 20250HB1649PN2003 - 309 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 remaining provisions of this subpart. It is declared as the legislative intent that this subpart would have been adopted had the unconstitutional word, phrase, clause, sentence, section or provision of this subpart not been included in this subpart.§ 2902. Saving clause and limitations.(a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any provision of the act of August 5, 1932 (Sp.Sess., P.L.45, No.45), referred to as the Sterling Act, the validity of an ordinance, part of an ordinance, a resolution or part of a resolution, including an amendment or supplement to the ordinance, part of the ordinance, resolution or part of the resolution enacted before, on or after the effective date of this section or adopted by a political subdivision of this Commonwealth for or relating to the imposition, levy or collection of a tax, shall not be affected or impaired by anything contained in this subpart.(b) Exceptions.--(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a rate of tax imposed by ordinance of a city of the first class under the Sterling Act on salaries, wages, commissions, compensation or other income received or to be received for work done or services performed within the city by persons who are not legal residents of the city, shall not, except as otherwise provided in this section, exceed the tax imposition rate of 4.3125% for the tax year 1977 or for any tax year thereafter.(2) If a city under paragraph (1) by ordinance imposes a tax rate on residents or nonresidents in excess of the tax rate under paragraph (1) on the income categories enumerated in this subpart:20250HB1649PN2003 - 310 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (i) The provisions of the ordinance imposing the tax rate increase on income of persons who are legal residents of the city shall be deemed valid and legally effective within the meaning and application of subsection (a).(ii) The provisions of the ordinance imposing a tax rate in excess of 4.3125% with respect to persons who are not legal residents of the city shall be deemed suspended and without validity to the extent that the tax rate exceeds the 4.3125% on income of the nonresidents. The excess tax rate provisions shall remain suspended and without validity until the date on which the city by ordinance imposes a rate of tax on income of both legal residents or nonresidents of the city in excess of the tax rate imposition of 5.75% per year.

The method of determining the amount to be withheld shall be to withhold the highest amount of tax imposed with provision in the ordinance to provide refunds of the excess tax withheld to qualified nonresident taxpayers within four months of the end of each calendar year.(4) If all or part of the provisions of subsection (b) are declared by a court to be unconstitutional, it shall be the duty of the court to construe the remaining provisions of this subpart in accordance with section 2901 (relating to constitutional construction).(c) Revenue commissioner, deductions and payments.--(1) Each employer having a place of business within this Commonwealth who employs one or more persons who are residents of a city of the first class shall:(i) within 30 days after becoming such an employer, register with the revenue commissioner of a city of the first class the employer's name and address and other information as the revenue commissioner may require; and(ii) at the time of payment to the employee, deduct from the salary, wages, commissions or compensation due the employee the tax imposed by the city of the first 20250HB1649PN2003 - 312 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 class on any salary, wage, commission or other compensation due the employee.(2) An employer required to withhold taxes under this subsection shall calculate the amount of salary, wages, commissions and compensation of each employee as determined under the classes of income under section 2203 (relating to classes of income).(3) Each employer employing one or more persons who are residents of a city of the first class who pay a tax imposed under this subpart shall file a return and pay to the revenue commissioner the amount of taxes deducted as provided under paragraph (2).

Raw Text:
2025-2026 Regular Session HB 1649 PN 2003 Bill Text (HTM) See other bills under thesame topic PRINTER'S NO. 2003 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIAHOUSE BILL No.1649 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY FINK, STAATS, BARGER, ZIMMERMAN, ROAE, COOK, ANDERSON AND RYNCAVAGE, JUNE 24, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, JUNE 24, 2025 AN ACTAmending Titles 53 (Municipalities Generally) and 72 (Taxation and Fiscal Affairs) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, eliminating school district property taxes; imposing county and school district taxes; establishing the School District Emergency Fund and the School District Property Tax Elimination Fund; consolidating Articles II and III of the Tax Reform Code of 1971; in preliminary provisions relating to sales and use tax, providing for definitions; in taxation generally relating to sales and use tax, providing for exclusions and for transfer to county sales and use tax accounts; in preliminary provisions relating to personal income tax, providing for definitions; and making repeals.This act may be referred to as the School Property Tax Elimination Act.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) School district property taxes are a fixed expense for property owners, which creates an unsustainable and regressive system of taxation impacting our fundamental rights of life, liberty and property. School district property taxes are not reflective of a property owner's ability to pay and are regressive in nature.(2) The current rate of increase of school district property taxes is unsustainable due to factors frequently 1234567891011121314151617181920212223 beyond the control of local school officials and school boards, including underfunded pensions, rapidly escalating health care costs, more complex educational requirements for students and unfunded mandates.(3) School district property taxes impact individuals differently. For example, if spouses are retired and one spouse passes away, the income reduction caused by the death is immediate, but the school district property tax burden remains unchanged. Other factors impacting older Pennsylvanians' ability to bear the burden of school district property taxes include the amount of financial assets in retirement, health, mobility and the proximity of family members. School district property taxes are problematic for working families as well, with young working families bearing the brunt of funding the State while managing such financial burdens as income taxes, exploding health care coverage costs and day care expenses.(4) This Commonwealth faces an additional risk through its tax structure and limited job creation, as young working families continue to relocate from this Commonwealth, partly as a result of Pennsylvania's tax system being specifically geared to taxation of income from working citizens, with retirement income not being taxed.(5) The Independent Fiscal Office reports that Pennsylvania is attracting more seniors as residents because of the tax status in this Commonwealth of retirement income, particularly when compared to neighboring states.(6) The demographic changes to this Commonwealth, fueled by the combination of the exodus of younger people from this Commonwealth and the migration of older people into this 20250HB1649PN2003 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Commonwealth, have precipitated a growing financial crisis.(7) School districts are fixed cost-intensive operations and seek stability in funding through property taxes, but the predictability and certainty of school district property taxes create contradictory impacts on property owners in meeting their tax obligations.(8) School district property tax reform must be accomplished in an equitable manner in the form of the total elimination of school district property taxes for residential and commercial properties. Businesses in this Commonwealth alone cannot and should not bear the financial burden caused by the elimination of school district property taxes on residential property only. (See 53 Pa.C.S. § 9011(a).)(9) School district property tax reform must also include rental properties, whereby each landlord must reduce rental payments required of each residential or commercial tenant in an amount equal to the reduction of taxes on real property attributable to a tenant's unit. (See 53 Pa.C.S. § 9017.)(10) This act provides for the elimination of school district property taxes through the following:(i) An increase in the sales, use and occupancy taxes, whereby a new or additional 2% tax shall be imposed on certain items and that money distributed to each county of this Commonwealth, which shall disburse money to school districts within the county from the School District Property Tax Elimination Fund. (See 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 90A Subchs. C and F.) For this purpose, certain exclusions from taxation are eliminated, including certain clothing, candy and gum. (See 53 20250HB1649PN2003 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Pa.C.S. § 90A22(b.1).)(ii) The imposition by each school district of a local tax on the personal income of resident taxpayers of the school district up to a maximum rate of 1.88%, the revenue from which shall be collected by and be solely for the use of school districts. (See 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 90A Subch. D.) For this purpose, compensation is expanded to include taxation of old age or retirement benefits, with the exception of Social Security benefits and other similar types of benefits enumerated under the definition of "compensation." (See the definition of "compensation" in 72 Pa.C.S. § 2102, which effectuates these changes.)(11) This act is not intended to reduce expenditures made to school districts in this Commonwealth. The purpose of this act is to shift a source of local school district funding away from school district property taxes in a manner that does not negatively impact school districts.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1.

The method of determining the amount to be withheld shall be to withhold the highest amount of tax imposed with provision in the ordinance to provide refunds of the excess tax withheld to qualified nonresident taxpayers within four months of the end of each calendar year.(4) If all or part of the provisions of subsection (b) are declared by a court to be unconstitutional, it shall be the duty of the court to construe the remaining provisions of this subpart in accordance with section 2901 (relating to constitutional construction).(c) Revenue commissioner, deductions and payments.--(1) Each employer having a place of business within this Commonwealth who employs one or more persons who are residents of a city of the first class shall:(i) within 30 days after becoming such an employer, register with the revenue commissioner of a city of the first class the employer's name and address and other information as the revenue commissioner may require; and(ii) at the time of payment to the employee, deduct from the salary, wages, commissions or compensation due the employee the tax imposed by the city of the first 20250HB1649PN2003 - 312 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 class on any salary, wage, commission or other compensation due the employee.(2) An employer required to withhold taxes under this subsection shall calculate the amount of salary, wages, commissions and compensation of each employee as determined under the classes of income under section 2203 (relating to classes of income).(3) Each employer employing one or more persons who are residents of a city of the first class who pay a tax imposed under this subpart shall file a return and pay to the revenue commissioner the amount of taxes deducted as provided under paragraph (2).
