Title 50 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended by adding parts to read:PART IPRELIMINARY PROVISIONS(Reserved)PART IIMINORSChapter10. Preliminary Provisions (Reserved) 11. Protecting Minors on Social Media CHAPTER 10PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS1234567891011121314151617 (Reserved)CHAPTER 11PROTECTING MINORS ON SOCIAL MEDIASubchapterA. General Provisions B.

This chapter relates to protecting minors on social media.§ 1102. Legislative intent. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) Social media use among American teenagers is nearly universal. According to the Pew Research Center, 95% of teens report using YouTube and 67% of teens have used TikTok, with 16% using TikTok almost constantly.(2) According to the Pew Research Center, 54% of teens say it would be difficult to give up social media entirely.(3) Social media use is linked to negative feelings among teens. A growing body of research, described in the International Journal of Adolescence and Youth and elsewhere, has found that increased social media use is associated with greater rates of depression and anxiety in teens. Additional research published in the Children and Youth Services Review 20250HB1430PN1665 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 describes a trend in which social media use can trigger and accelerate offline violence.(4) Rates of suicide and self-harm among American teenagers have grown dramatically in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that, in 2021, three in five girls felt persistently sad and hopeless, while more than one in four girls reported seriously considering attempting suicide. These rates have increased significantly since 2011.(5) Federal and State policymakers are beginning to recognize the risks that social media use places on American youth. A number of recent policy proposals provide parents and guardians of teenagers with greater oversight over their children's social media use.(6) In May 2023, the United States Surgeon General released a health advisory finding that "more research is needed to fully understand the impact of social media; however, the current body of evidence indicates that while social media may have benefits for some children and adolescents, there are ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents." The advisory recommends a range of policies to consider, including "policies that further limit access - in ways that minimize the risk of harm - to social media for all children, including strengthening and enforcing age minimums."(7) In addition to empowering parents and guardians to protect children against these risks, policymakers are establishing mechanisms to hold social media companies accountable for harm to children and youth.20250HB1430PN1665 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (8) Greater oversight of social media platforms will enable families in this Commonwealth to use online tools in a more productive and healthy fashion.§ 1103.
