Chapter 32 heading of Title 18 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended to read:CHAPTER 3212345678910111213141516171819202122232425 [ABORTION]REPRODUCTIVE OFFENSESSection 2. Sections 3201 and 3202 of Title 18 are repealed:[ยง 3201. Short title of chapter.This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Abortion Control Act."ยง 3202. Legislative intent.(a) Rights and interests.--It is the intention of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to protect hereby the life and health of the woman subject to abortion and to protect the life and health of the child subject to abortion. It is the further intention of the General Assembly to foster the development of standards of professional conduct in a critical area of medical practice, to provide for development of statistical data and to protect the right of the minor woman voluntarily to decide to submit to abortion or to carry her child to term. The General Assembly finds as fact that the rights and interests furthered by this chapter are not secure in the context in which abortion is presently performed.(b) Conclusions.--Reliable and convincing evidence has compelled the General Assembly to conclude and the General Assembly does hereby solemnly declare and find that:(1) Many women now seek or are encouraged to undergo abortions without full knowledge of the development of the unborn child or of alternatives to abortion.(2) The gestational age at which viability of an unborn child occurs has been lowering substantially and steadily as advances in neonatal medical care continue to be made.(3) A significant number of late-term abortions result in live births, or in delivery of children who could survive 20250HB0026PN0007 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 if measures were taken to bring about breathing. Some physicians have been allowing these children to die or have been failing to induce breathing.(4) Because the Commonwealth places a supreme value upon protecting human life, it is necessary that those physicians which it permits to practice medicine be held to precise standards of care in cases where their actions do or may result in the death of an unborn child.(5) A reasonable waiting period, as contained in this chapter, is critical to the assurance that a woman elect to undergo an abortion procedure only after having the fullest opportunity to give her informed consent thereto.(c) Construction.--In every relevant civil or criminal proceeding in which it is possible to do so without violating the Federal Constitution, the common and statutory law of Pennsylvania shall be construed so as to extend to the unborn the equal protection of the laws and to further the public policy of this Commonwealth encouraging childbirth over abortion.(d) Right of conscience.--It is the further public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to respect and protect the right of conscience of all persons who refuse to obtain, receive, subsidize, accept or provide abortions including those persons who are engaged in the delivery of medical services and medical care whether acting individually, corporately or in association with other persons; and to prohibit all forms of discrimination, disqualification, coercion, disability or imposition of liability or financial burden upon such persons or entities by reason of their refusing to act contrary to their conscience or conscientious convictions in refusing to obtain, 20250HB0026PN0007 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 receive, subsidize, accept or provide abortions.]Section 3.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the common law rights of parents.20250HB0026PN0007 - 15 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 ยง 3207.

Chapter 32 heading of Title 18 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended to read:CHAPTER 3212345678910111213141516171819202122232425 [ABORTION]REPRODUCTIVE OFFENSESSection 2. Sections 3201 and 3202 of Title 18 are repealed:[ยง 3201. Short title of chapter.This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Abortion Control Act."ยง 3202. Legislative intent.(a) Rights and interests.--It is the intention of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to protect hereby the life and health of the woman subject to abortion and to protect the life and health of the child subject to abortion. It is the further intention of the General Assembly to foster the development of standards of professional conduct in a critical area of medical practice, to provide for development of statistical data and to protect the right of the minor woman voluntarily to decide to submit to abortion or to carry her child to term. The General Assembly finds as fact that the rights and interests furthered by this chapter are not secure in the context in which abortion is presently performed.(b) Conclusions.--Reliable and convincing evidence has compelled the General Assembly to conclude and the General Assembly does hereby solemnly declare and find that:(1) Many women now seek or are encouraged to undergo abortions without full knowledge of the development of the unborn child or of alternatives to abortion.(2) The gestational age at which viability of an unborn child occurs has been lowering substantially and steadily as advances in neonatal medical care continue to be made.(3) A significant number of late-term abortions result in live births, or in delivery of children who could survive 20250HB0026PN0007 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 if measures were taken to bring about breathing. Some physicians have been allowing these children to die or have been failing to induce breathing.(4) Because the Commonwealth places a supreme value upon protecting human life, it is necessary that those physicians which it permits to practice medicine be held to precise standards of care in cases where their actions do or may result in the death of an unborn child.(5) A reasonable waiting period, as contained in this chapter, is critical to the assurance that a woman elect to undergo an abortion procedure only after having the fullest opportunity to give her informed consent thereto.(c) Construction.--In every relevant civil or criminal proceeding in which it is possible to do so without violating the Federal Constitution, the common and statutory law of Pennsylvania shall be construed so as to extend to the unborn the equal protection of the laws and to further the public policy of this Commonwealth encouraging childbirth over abortion.(d) Right of conscience.--It is the further public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to respect and protect the right of conscience of all persons who refuse to obtain, receive, subsidize, accept or provide abortions including those persons who are engaged in the delivery of medical services and medical care whether acting individually, corporately or in association with other persons; and to prohibit all forms of discrimination, disqualification, coercion, disability or imposition of liability or financial burden upon such persons or entities by reason of their refusing to act contrary to their conscience or conscientious convictions in refusing to obtain, 20250HB0026PN0007 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 receive, subsidize, accept or provide abortions.]Section 3.
