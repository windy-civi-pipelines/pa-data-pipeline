Section 4343 of Title 23 is repealed:[§ 4343. Paternity.(a) Determination.--Where the paternity of a child born out of wedlock is disputed, the determination of paternity shall be made by the court in a civil action without a jury. A putative father may not be prohibited from initiating a civil action to establish paternity. The burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. Bills for pregnancy, childbirth, postnatal care related to the pregnancy and genetic testing are admissible as evidence without requiring third-party foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence of amounts incurred for such services or for testing on behalf of the child. If there is clear and convincing evidence of paternity on the basis of genetic tests or other evidence, the court shall upon motion of a party issue a temporary order of support pending the judicial resolution of a dispute regarding paternity. The Supreme Court shall provide by general rule for entry of a default order establishing paternity upon a showing of service of process on the defendant and a subsequent failure to appear for scheduled genetic testing.(b) Limitation of actions.--(1) An action or proceeding under this chapter to establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock must be commenced within 18 years of the date of birth of the child.(2) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because of a prior statute of limitations of less than 18 years.20250HB0350PN1880 - 7 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (c) Genetic tests.--(1) Upon the request of any party to an action to establish paternity, supported by a sworn statement from the party, the court or domestic relations section shall require the child and the parties to submit to genetic tests. The domestic relations section shall obtain an additional genetic test upon the request and advance payment by any party who contests the initial test.(2) Genetic test results indicating a 99% or greater probability that the alleged father is the father of the child shall create a presumption of paternity which may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests are not reliable in that particular case.(3) To ensure the integrity of the specimen and that the proper chain of custody has been maintained, the genetic tests of the biological mother, the child or children in question and the alleged father should be conducted by an established genetic-testing laboratory in the course of its regularly conducted business activity, and certified records should be issued. The certified records shall be admissible into evidence without further foundation, authentication or proof of accuracy if no objection is made within ten days prior to trial. The laboratory must be certified by either the American Association of Blood Banks or the American Association for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.(4) If the court or domestic relations section orders genetic testing, the domestic relations section shall pay the cost of the test, subject to recoupment from the alleged father if paternity is established.20250HB0350PN1880 - 8 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (5) A determination of paternity made by another state, whether through judicial proceedings, administrative proceedings or by acknowledgment of paternity, shall be given full faith and credit in the courts of this Commonwealth.(6) A determination of nonpaternity made by another state with respect to a public assistance recipient shall not be binding upon the Department of Public Welfare unless the defendant shows that the department had actual notice of the proceedings, including the date and time of any trial, and a fair opportunity to participate in all material proceedings through counsel of its own choice.]Section 5.

The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures by which each interested party shall be notified of all proceedings in which support obligations might be established or modified and shall receive a copy of any order issued in a case within 14 days after issuance of such order. A petition for modification of a support order may be filed at any time and shall be granted 20250HB0350PN1880 - 9 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances.* * *Section 6.

The hospital or other person accepting an acknowledgment of paternity shall provide written and oral notice, which may be through the use of video or audio equipment, to the birth mother and birth father of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of and the rights and responsibilities that arise from, signing the acknowledgment.(b) Claim of paternity.--If the mother of the child fails or refuses to join in the acknowledgment of paternity provided for in subsection (a), the Department of Public Welfare shall index it as a claim of paternity. The filing and indexing of a claim of paternity shall not confer upon the putative father any rights as to the child except that the putative father shall be entitled to notice of any proceeding brought to terminate any 20250HB0350PN1880 - 10 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 parental rights as to the child.(c) Duty of hospital or birthing center.--Upon the birth of a child to an unmarried woman, an agent of the hospital or birthing center where the birth occurred shall:(1) Provide the newborn's birth parents with an opportunity to complete an acknowledgment of paternity.

An asserted genetic relationship between an individual and a child."Probability of parentage." For the ethnic or racial group to which an individual alleged to be a parent belongs, the probability that a hypothesized genetic relationship is supported, compared to the probability that a genetic relationship is supported between the child and a random individual of the ethnic or racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship, expressed as a percentage incorporating the combined relationship index and a prior probability."Relationship index." A likelihood ratio that compares the probability of a genetic marker given a hypothesized genetic relationship and the probability of the genetic marker given a genetic relationship between the child and a random individual of the ethnic or racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship.§ 9502. Scope of chapter; limitation on use of genetic testing.(a) General rule.--This chapter governs genetic testing of an individual in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, whether the individual:(1) voluntarily submits to testing; or(2) is tested under an order of the court or a child-support agency.(b) Prohibited uses.--Genetic testing may not be used:20250HB0350PN1880 - 30 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (1) to challenge the parentage status of an individual who is a parent under Chapter 97 (relating to assisted reproduction) or 98 (relating to surrogacy agreement); or(2) to establish the parentage status of an individual who is a donor.§ 9503. Authority to order or deny genetic testing.(a) General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or Chapter 96 (relating to proceeding to adjudicate parentage), in a proceeding under this part to determine parentage, the court shall order the child and any other individual to submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the sworn statement of a party:(1) alleging a reasonable possibility that the individual is the child's genetic parent; or(2) denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts establishing a reasonable possibility that the individual is not a genetic parent.(b) When permitted.--The court or a child-support agency may order genetic testing only if there is no presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated parent of a child other than the individual who gave birth to the child.(c) In utero genetic testing prohibited.--The court or child-support agency may not order in utero genetic testing.(d) Multiple individuals.--If two or more individuals are subject to court-ordered genetic testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently or sequentially.(e) Subjects.--Genetic testing of an individual who gave birth to a child is not a condition precedent to testing of the child and another individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being determined. If the individual who gave birth is 20250HB0350PN1880 - 31 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 unavailable or declines to submit to genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and each other individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being adjudicated.(f) Discretion to deny motion.--In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed parent or an individual who claims to be a parent under section 9609 (relating to adjudicating claim of de facto parentage of child), or to challenge an acknowledgment of parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the child and any other individual after considering the factors in section 9613(a) and (b) (relating to adjudicating competing claims of parentage).(g) Conditions requiring denial of motion.--If an individual requesting genetic testing is barred under Chapter 96 from establishing the individual's parentage status, the court shall deny the request for genetic testing.(h) Enforcement.--An order under this section for genetic testing is enforceable by contempt.§ 9504. Requirements for genetic testing.(a) Types authorized.--Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory accredited by:(1) the AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions; or(2) an accrediting body designated by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.(b) Specimens.--A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair or other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing.20250HB0350PN1880 - 32 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (c) Calculation of relationship index.--Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculating a relationship index. If an individual or a child-support agency objects to the laboratory's choice, the following rules apply:(1) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the report of the test, the objecting individual or child-support agency may request the court to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory.(2) The individual or the child-support agency objecting to the laboratory's choice under this subsection shall:(i) if the requested frequencies are not available to the laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or(ii) engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.(3) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question of which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.(d) Discretion to require additional genetic testing.--If, after recalculation of the relationship index under subsection (c) using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing under section 9506 (relating to genetic testing results; challenge to results) does not identify an individual as a genetic parent of a child, the court may require an individual 20250HB0350PN1880 - 33 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 who has been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.§ 9505. Report of genetic testing.(a) Requirements.--A report of genetic testing must be in a record and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of this chapter is self-authenticating.(b) Admissibility of documentation.--Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without testimony:(1) the name and photograph of each individual whose specimen has been taken;(2) the name of the individual who collected each specimen;(3) the place and date each specimen was collected;(4) the name of the individual who received each specimen in the testing laboratory; and(5) the date each specimen was received.§ 9506. Genetic testing results; challenge to results.(a) General rule.--Subject to a challenge under subsection (b), an individual is identified under this part as a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with this chapter and the results of the testing disclose:(1) that the individual has at least a 99% probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and(2) a combined relationship index of at least 100 to 1.(b) When challenge permitted.--An individual identified 20250HB0350PN1880 - 34 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 under subsection (a) as a genetic parent of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing satisfying the requirements of this chapter which:(1) excludes the individual as a genetic parent of the child; or(2) identifies another individual as a possible genetic parent of the child other than:(i) the individual who gave birth to the child; or(ii) the individual identified under subsection (a).(c) Discretion to require further genetic testing.--Except as otherwise provided in section 9511 (relating to identical siblings), if more than one individual other than the individual who gave birth is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of the child, the court shall order each individual to submit to further genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.§ 9507. Cost of genetic testing.(a) General rule.--Subject to assessment of fees under Chapter 96 (relating to proceeding to adjudicate parentage), payment of the cost of initial genetic testing must be made:(1) by a child-support agency in a proceeding in which the child-support agency provides services;(2) by the individual who made the request for genetic testing;(3) as agreed by the parties; or(4) as ordered by the court.(b) Reimbursement authorized.--If the cost of genetic testing is paid by the child-support agency, the child-support agency may seek reimbursement from the genetic parent whose parent-child relationship is established.20250HB0350PN1880 - 35 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 § 9508. Additional genetic testing.The court or child-support agency shall order additional genetic testing on request of an individual who contests the result of the initial testing under section 9506 (relating to genetic testing results; challenge to results). If initial genetic testing under section 9506 identifies an individual as a genetic parent of the child, the court or agency may not order additional testing unless the contesting individual pays for the testing in advance.§ 9509. Genetic testing when specimen not available.(a) Individuals subject to.--Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic testing specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a child, an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may order any of the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic testing:(1) a parent of the alleged genetic parent;(2) a sibling of the alleged genetic parent;(3) another child of the alleged genetic parent and the individual who gave birth to the other child; and(4) another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to complete genetic testing.(b) Balancing test.--To issue an order under this section, the court must find that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested.§ 9510. Deceased individual.If an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased individual.§ 9511. Identical siblings.20250HB0350PN1880 - 36 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (a) General rule.--If the court finds there is reason to believe that an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may order genetic testing of the sibling.(b) Nongenetic evidence.--If more than one sibling is identified under section 9506 (relating to genetic testing results; challenge to results) as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent of the child.§ 9512. Confidentiality of genetic testing.(a) General rule.--Release of a report of genetic testing for parentage is controlled by the law of this Commonwealth other than this part.(b) Penalty.--An individual who intentionally releases an identifiable specimen of another individual collected for genetic testing under this chapter for a purpose not relevant to a proceeding regarding parentage, without a court order or written permission of the individual who furnished the specimen, commits a misdemeanor of the third degree.CHAPTER 96PROCEEDING TO ADJUDICATE PARENTAGESubchapterA.

The domestic relations section shall obtain an additional genetic test upon the request and advance payment by any party who contests the initial test.(2) Genetic test results indicating a 99% or greater probability that the alleged father is the father of the child shall create a presumption of paternity which may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests are not reliable in that particular case.(3) To ensure the integrity of the specimen and that the proper chain of custody has been maintained, the genetic tests of the biological mother, the child or children in question and the alleged father should be conducted by an established genetic-testing laboratory in the course of its regularly conducted business activity, and certified records should be issued. The certified records shall be admissible into evidence without further foundation, authentication or proof of accuracy if no objection is made within ten days prior to trial. The laboratory must be certified by either the American Association of Blood Banks or the American Association for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.(4) If the court or domestic relations section orders genetic testing, the domestic relations section shall pay the cost of the test, subject to recoupment from the alleged father if paternity is established.20250HB0350PN1880 - 8 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (5) A determination of paternity made by another state, whether through judicial proceedings, administrative proceedings or by acknowledgment of paternity, shall be given full faith and credit in the courts of this Commonwealth.(6) A determination of nonpaternity made by another state with respect to a public assistance recipient shall not be binding upon the Department of Public Welfare unless the defendant shows that the department had actual notice of the proceedings, including the date and time of any trial, and a fair opportunity to participate in all material proceedings through counsel of its own choice.]Section 5.

The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures by which each interested party shall be notified of all proceedings in which support obligations might be established or modified and shall receive a copy of any order issued in a case within 14 days after issuance of such order. A petition for modification of a support order may be filed at any time and shall be granted 20250HB0350PN1880 - 9 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances.* * *Section 6.

The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing.20250HB0350PN1880 - 32 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (c) Calculation of relationship index.--Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculating a relationship index. If an individual or a child-support agency objects to the laboratory's choice, the following rules apply:(1) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the report of the test, the objecting individual or child-support agency may request the court to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory.(2) The individual or the child-support agency objecting to the laboratory's choice under this subsection shall:(i) if the requested frequencies are not available to the laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or(ii) engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.(3) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question of which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.(d) Discretion to require additional genetic testing.--If, after recalculation of the relationship index under subsection (c) using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing under section 9506 (relating to genetic testing results; challenge to results) does not identify an individual as a genetic parent of a child, the court may require an individual 20250HB0350PN1880 - 33 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 who has been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.§ 9505. Report of genetic testing.(a) Requirements.--A report of genetic testing must be in a record and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of this chapter is self-authenticating.(b) Admissibility of documentation.--Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without testimony:(1) the name and photograph of each individual whose specimen has been taken;(2) the name of the individual who collected each specimen;(3) the place and date each specimen was collected;(4) the name of the individual who received each specimen in the testing laboratory; and(5) the date each specimen was received.§ 9506. Genetic testing results; challenge to results.(a) General rule.--Subject to a challenge under subsection (b), an individual is identified under this part as a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with this chapter and the results of the testing disclose:(1) that the individual has at least a 99% probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and(2) a combined relationship index of at least 100 to 1.(b) When challenge permitted.--An individual identified 20250HB0350PN1880 - 34 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 under subsection (a) as a genetic parent of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing satisfying the requirements of this chapter which:(1) excludes the individual as a genetic parent of the child; or(2) identifies another individual as a possible genetic parent of the child other than:(i) the individual who gave birth to the child; or(ii) the individual identified under subsection (a).(c) Discretion to require further genetic testing.--Except as otherwise provided in section 9511 (relating to identical siblings), if more than one individual other than the individual who gave birth is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of the child, the court shall order each individual to submit to further genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.§ 9507. Cost of genetic testing.(a) General rule.--Subject to assessment of fees under Chapter 96 (relating to proceeding to adjudicate parentage), payment of the cost of initial genetic testing must be made:(1) by a child-support agency in a proceeding in which the child-support agency provides services;(2) by the individual who made the request for genetic testing;(3) as agreed by the parties; or(4) as ordered by the court.(b) Reimbursement authorized.--If the cost of genetic testing is paid by the child-support agency, the child-support agency may seek reimbursement from the genetic parent whose parent-child relationship is established.20250HB0350PN1880 - 35 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 § 9508. Additional genetic testing.The court or child-support agency shall order additional genetic testing on request of an individual who contests the result of the initial testing under section 9506 (relating to genetic testing results; challenge to results). If initial genetic testing under section 9506 identifies an individual as a genetic parent of the child, the court or agency may not order additional testing unless the contesting individual pays for the testing in advance.§ 9509. Genetic testing when specimen not available.(a) Individuals subject to.--Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic testing specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a child, an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may order any of the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic testing:(1) a parent of the alleged genetic parent;(2) a sibling of the alleged genetic parent;(3) another child of the alleged genetic parent and the individual who gave birth to the other child; and(4) another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to complete genetic testing.(b) Balancing test.--To issue an order under this section, the court must find that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested.§ 9510. Deceased individual.If an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased individual.§ 9511. Identical siblings.20250HB0350PN1880 - 36 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (a) General rule.--If the court finds there is reason to believe that an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may order genetic testing of the sibling.(b) Nongenetic evidence.--If more than one sibling is identified under section 9506 (relating to genetic testing results; challenge to results) as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent of the child.§ 9512. Confidentiality of genetic testing.(a) General rule.--Release of a report of genetic testing for parentage is controlled by the law of this Commonwealth other than this part.(b) Penalty.--An individual who intentionally releases an identifiable specimen of another individual collected for genetic testing under this chapter for a purpose not relevant to a proceeding regarding parentage, without a court order or written permission of the individual who furnished the specimen, commits a misdemeanor of the third degree.CHAPTER 96PROCEEDING TO ADJUDICATE PARENTAGESubchapterA.
