Scope of chapter.This chapter provides for public servant data privacy.§ 902. Findings and declarations.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) Judges, lawmakers and other elected and appointed public servants and their staff play an essential role in the free and fair functioning of our government. While the nature of their official duties will undoubtedly draw occasional disapproval and criticism from members of the public, our public servants and their families have experienced sharp increases in recent years in the volume and severity of intimidating abuse, threats and violent attacks, including attempted assassinations, some of which have been perpetrated by malefactors obtaining the home addresses or other unlisted contact information of their targets.(2) These threats and attacks create a chilling effect and constrain how freely our officials interact with the public, narrows the spectrum of positions they feel safe to take or support and make them less willing to continue in public service. This persistent and severe problem is an affront to the effective functioning of our government and the rule of law.(3) Violence against and intimidation of our public servants and their families is made easier by data brokers disseminating private information, enabling assailants to easily compile dossiers on the public officials the assailants target.(4) Having personal information easily accessible at the click of a button provides negligible value to the public and poses grave danger to our public officials and their 20250HB1822PN2332 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 families.(5) This chapter is implemented to foster the ability of these public servants who perform critical governmental roles to carry out their official duties without fear of personal reprisal.§ 903.
