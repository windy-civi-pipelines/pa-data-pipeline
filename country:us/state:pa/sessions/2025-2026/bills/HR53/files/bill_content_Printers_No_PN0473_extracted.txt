andWHEREAS, While Pennsylvania's renewable energy production is increasing, this Commonwealth still ranks near the bottom in the nation for renewable energy generation; andWHEREAS, According to data from the Federal Energy Information Administration, as of 2023, Pennsylvania ranked 45th in the nation in energy production from hydropower, solar and wind; andWHEREAS, In 2023, more than half of the 250,000 jobs added in the energy sector were in renewable energy and jobs in renewable energy grew at more than twice the rate of the overall United States labor market; andWHEREAS, According to the United States Department of 123456789101112131415161718 Energy's annual United States Energy and Employment Report published in September 2024, renewable energy jobs comprise more than 40% of the country's 8.35 million people employed in the energy industry; andWHEREAS, Renewable energy projects are not only good for the environment by helping to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions, but jobs in the renewable energy production sector are generally good-paying, family-sustaining jobs due to the high demand for skilled workers and the rapid growth of the sector; andWHEREAS, Erie County is home to a strong manufacturing infrastructure, training programs, institutions that focus on manufacturing innovation and skills and a skilled workforce that can tap into the renewable energy economy for both northwestern Pennsylvania and the entire Commonwealth; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the House of Representatives direct the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study and issue a report on the feasibility and potential benefits or drawbacks of developing offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy projects on Pennsylvania's portion of Lake Erie; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the study:(1) identify and examine the potential job creation by developing offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy projects on Pennsylvania's portion of Lake Erie, including the types of jobs that may be created, such as construction, maintenance and manufacturing of parts and transportation, and the expected salary of each type of job;(2) aggregate the existing economic impact analysis of the establishment of offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy projects on Pennsylvania's portion of Lake Erie;20250HR0053PN0473 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (3) identify best practices for the development and implementation of offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy projects for the Lake Erie region;(4) aggregate the potential reduction in air and climate pollution and carbon emissions that may be diverted by developing offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy on Pennsylvania's portion of Lake Erie; and(5) aggregate the amount of power that may be created from offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy projects on Pennsylvania's portion of Lake Erie, and the projected number of houses that this energy could approximately power on an annual basis;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission consult with organizations and businesses that:(1) have organizational missions and expertise in the development, production and maintenance of offshore hydropower, solar and wind energy projects in the United States, or make parts and components necessary for these projects;(2) have expertise on aquatic habitat protection, bird habitat and migratory flight patterns and ecosystem protection;(3) are labor leaders and experts in the region and Statewide; and(4) have knowledge of relevant issues;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission be authorized to consult with surrounding states and business leaders that have knowledge of relevant issues;
