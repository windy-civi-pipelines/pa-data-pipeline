In considering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve a request by two or more parties to have their individual interests aggregated.(b) Partition by sale or dismissal of action.--If the court does not order partition in kind under subsection (a), the court shall order partition by sale under section 21A30 (relating to open-market sale, sealed bids or auction) or, if no cotenant requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.(c) Payments.--If the court orders partition in kind under subsection (a), the court may require that one or more cotenants pay one or more other cotenants amounts so that the payments, taken together with the value of the in-kind distributions to the cotenants, will make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to the fractional interests held.(d) Allocation of interests among unknown, unlocatable or defaulting cotenants.--If the court orders partition in kind, the court shall allocate to the cotenants that are unknown, unlocatable or the subject of a default judgment, if their interests were not bought out under section 21A27, a part of the 20250HB1498PN1832 - 13 - <--123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 property representing the combined interests of these cotenants as determined by the court and this part of the property shall remain undivided.§ 21A29. Considerations for partition in kind.(a) Prejudice determination.--In determining under section 21A28(a) (relating to partition alternatives) whether partition in kind would result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group, the court shall consider the following:(1) whether the heirs property practicably can be divided among the cotenants;(2) whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a way that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the value of the property if it were sold as a whole, taking into account the condition under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;(3) evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a cotenant and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the cotenant who are or were relatives of the cotenant or each other;(4) a cotenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the cotenant;(5) the lawful use being made of the property by a cotenant and the degree to which the cotenant would be harmed if the cotenant could not continue the same use of the property;(6) the degree to which the cotenants have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance and 20250HB1498PN1832 - 14 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance or upkeep of the property; and(7) any other relevant factor.(b) Weighing totality of considerations.--The court may not consider any one factor in subsection (a) to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances.§ 21A30. Open-market sale, sealed bids or auction.(a) Sale requirements.--If the court orders a sale of heirs property, the sale must be an open-market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or an auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest of the cotenants as a group.(b) Appointment of broker.--If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, not later than 10 days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate broker licensed in this Commonwealth to offer the property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission. If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker licensed in this Commonwealth to offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission.

Considerations for partition in kind.(a) Prejudice determination.--In determining under section 21A28(a) (relating to partition alternatives) whether partition in kind would result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group, the court shall consider the following:(1) whether the heirs property practicably can be divided among the cotenants;(2) whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a way that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the value of the property if it were sold as a whole, taking into account the condition under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;(3) evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a cotenant and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the cotenant who are or were relatives of the cotenant or each other;(4) a cotenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the cotenant;(5) the lawful use being made of the property by a cotenant and the degree to which the cotenant would be harmed if the cotenant could not continue the same use of the property;(6) the degree to which the cotenants have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance and 20250HB1498PN1832 - 14 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance or upkeep of the property; and(7) any other relevant factor.(b) Weighing totality of considerations.--The court may not consider any one factor in subsection (a) to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances.§ 21A30. Open-market sale, sealed bids or auction.(a) Sale requirements.--If the court orders a sale of heirs property, the sale must be an open-market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or an auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest of the cotenants as a group.(b) Appointment of broker.--If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, not later than 10 days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate broker licensed in this Commonwealth to offer the property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission.
