Definitions.The following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:"Carbon capture, utilization and storage technology." Technologies or methods that:(1) remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or prevent carbon dioxide emission; and(2) utilize carbon dioxide in the concrete manufacturing process resulting in structural performance improvements, the avoidance of carbon emissions or the permanent sequestration of carbon emissions in durable materials."Commonwealth agency." As defined in section 103 (relating to definitions)."Concrete." The term shall include structural masonry or precast or ready-mix concrete building products."Cost of delivery."
