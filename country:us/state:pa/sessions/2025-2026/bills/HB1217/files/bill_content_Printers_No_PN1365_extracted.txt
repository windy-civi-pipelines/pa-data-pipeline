If a sample is to be tested, the sample shall consist of a random selection of at least ten per cent of the devices. The test shall be conducted by processing a group of ballots, 20250HB1217PN1365 - 86 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 causing the device to output results for the ballots processed and comparing the output of results to the results expected for the ballots processed.

The device must be determined by the county election board to be satisfactory before the device may be used in an election. The county election board shall announce at the close of the first testing the date, place and time that an unsatisfactory device will be retested or may, at the option of the board, notify by telephone each person who was present at the first testing as to the date, place and time that the retesting will occur.(o) Records must be kept of all preelection testing of electronic or electromechanical tabulation devices used in an election. The records shall be present and available for inspection and reference during public preelection testing by any person in attendance during the testing. The need of the county election board for access to the records during the testing shall take precedence over the need of other attendees to access such records so that the work of the county election board will not be delayed or hindered. Records of testing must 20250HB1217PN1365 - 88 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 include, for each device, the name of each person who tested the device and the date, place, time and results of each test.

If a sample is to be tested, the sample shall consist of a random selection of at least ten per cent of the devices. The test shall be conducted by processing a group of ballots, 20250HB1217PN1365 - 86 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 causing the device to output results for the ballots processed and comparing the output of results to the results expected for the ballots processed.

The device must be determined by the county election board to be satisfactory before the device may be used in an election. The county election board shall announce at the close of the first testing the date, place and time that an unsatisfactory device will be retested or may, at the option of the board, notify by telephone each person who was present at the first testing as to the date, place and time that the retesting will occur.(o) Records must be kept of all preelection testing of electronic or electromechanical tabulation devices used in an election. The records shall be present and available for inspection and reference during public preelection testing by any person in attendance during the testing. The need of the county election board for access to the records during the testing shall take precedence over the need of other attendees to access such records so that the work of the county election board will not be delayed or hindered. Records of testing must 20250HB1217PN1365 - 88 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 include, for each device, the name of each person who tested the device and the date, place, time and results of each test.
