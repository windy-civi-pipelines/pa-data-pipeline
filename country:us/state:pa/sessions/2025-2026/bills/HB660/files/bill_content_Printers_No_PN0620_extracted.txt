DAVIS, ISAACSON, SHUSTERMAN, BOROWSKI, CEPHAS, MULLINS, MUNROE, McNEILL, DALEY, HOWARD, BRIGGS, SIEGEL AND SALISBURY, FEBRUARY 18, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON ENERGY, FEBRUARY 18, 2025 AN ACTProviding for minimum energy and water efficiency standards for certain products sold in this Commonwealth; imposing penalties; and making repeals.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Pennsylvania Energy and Water Efficiency Standards Act.Section 2. General purpose, legislative findings and scope.(a) General purpose.--This act establishes minimum energy and water efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in this Commonwealth.(b) Legislative findings.--The General Assembly finds that:(1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in this Commonwealth assure consumers and businesses that the products meet minimum efficiency 12345678910111213141516 performance levels, resulting in reduced energy and water waste and saving consumers and businesses money on utility bills.(2) Efficiency standards contribute to the economy of this Commonwealth by helping to better balance supply and demand for both energy and water, resulting in reduced pressure that creates higher natural gas, electricity and water prices. By saving consumers and businesses money on utility bills, efficiency standards help the Commonwealth and local economy save on utility bills that can be spent on local goods and services.(3) The efficiency standards save energy and thus reduce pollution and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution and use of electricity, natural gas and other fuels.(4) The water efficiency standards save water and thus reduce the strain on the water supply. Improved water efficiency can reduce or delay the need for water and sewer infrastructure improvements.(5) The efficiency standards can make electricity and natural gas systems more reliable by reducing the strain on systems during peak demand periods. Improved efficiency can reduce or delay the need for new power plants, power transmission lines and power distribution system upgrades as well as new and expanded gas pipelines.(c) Scope.--The provisions of this act apply to:(1) Commercial dishwashers.(2) Commercial fryers.(3) Commercial hot-food holding cabinets.(4) Commercial ovens.20250HB0660PN0620 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (5) Commercial steam cookers.(6) Faucets.(7) Gas fireplaces.(8) High CRI fluorescent lamps, cold-temperature fluorescent lamps and impact-resistant fluorescent lamps.(9) Portable electric spas.(10) Residential ventilating fans.(11) Showerheads.(12) Spray sprinkler bodies.(13) Urinals.(14) Water closets.(15) Water coolers.(d) Limitation.--Nothing in this act may be construed to:(1) Apply to new products manufactured in this Commonwealth and sold outside of this Commonwealth.(2) Apply to new products manufactured outside of this Commonwealth and sold at wholesale inside this Commonwealth for final retail sale and installation outside of this Commonwealth.(3) Apply to products installed in mobile manufactured homes at the time of construction.(4) Apply to products designed expressly for installation and use in recreational vehicles.(5) Constitute a ban on products covered under this act.(6) Prohibit the use, sale or installation of used products or parts.Section 3.
