2025-2026 Regular Session HR 82 PN 0684 Bill Text (HTM) See other bills under thesame topic PRINTER'S NO. 684 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIAHOUSE RESOLUTION No.82 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY WEBSTER, HILL-EVANS, SANCHEZ, GIRAL AND CERRATO, FEBRUARY 20, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION, FEBRUARY 20, 2025 A RESOLUTIONDirecting the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing a low-emission and zero-emission vehicle program in this Commonwealth and to issue a report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly.WHEREAS, In 2020, Steve Sisolak, Governor of Nevada, directed the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection to develop and adopt a process that would provide for the establishment of low-emission and zero-emission vehicle requirements for automakers; andWHEREAS, The initiative, known as Clean Cars Nevada, was developed as a means of providing residents of Nevada with a greater number of choices when considering the purchase of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles; andWHEREAS, Clean Cars Nevada has been touted as being critical to advancing a healthy, resilient and climate-friendly future; andWHEREAS, Under Clean Cars Nevada, low-emission vehicle standards require that automakers provide new vehicle models 12345678910111213141516171819 that emit fewer greenhouse gases and other air pollutants; andWHEREAS, Under this initiative, automakers can implement cost-effective technologies for gasoline-powered vehicles such as improvements to engines and transmissions and the use of light-weight materials in vehicle production; andWHEREAS, Clean Cars Nevada, the zero-emission vehicle program, ensures that automakers annually deliver more vehicles for sale in Nevada that achieve zero emissions by being partially or fully electric thus providing consumers with greater vehicle purchasing options; andWHEREAS, In addition to Nevada, 13 other states have adopted a zero-emission vehicle program, which has increased the availability of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle models at dealerships; andWHEREAS, Fossil fuel-powered vehicles emit many health-threatening pollutants, such as benzene, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, organic compounds and nitrogen oxide; andWHEREAS, These pollutants and particulate matter are collectively linked to many adverse health effects such as aggravated asthma, damage to the immune system, decreased lung function, increased risk of cancer, inflammation of airways, as well as developmental, neurological and reproductive health issues; andWHEREAS, In addition to the increased health benefits of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles, a recent study found that, if purchased, the average consumer could expect to save up to $12,000 over the lifetime of the vehicles; andWHEREAS, For those who finance the purchase of a low-emission or zero-emission vehicle, monthly expenditures for a typical six-year loan would be significantly lower; and20250HR0082PN0684 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 WHEREAS, The increased deployment of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles would attract investments in charging infrastructure thus creating additional jobs relative to the installation and operation of charging stations and equipment; andWHEREAS, Under Clean Cars Nevada, it was determined that cleaner, more efficient vehicles would appeal to both urban and rural drivers as both would experience significant savings on fuel; andWHEREAS, Since lower-income families tend to spend a larger portion of their incomes on gasoline as compared to families with higher incomes, the reduced costs of fuel would likely have a greater benefit on those with lower incomes; andWHEREAS, Families with lower incomes disproportionately buy used vehicles, so the adoption of a low-emission and zero-emission vehicle program would likely increase the demand for these vehicles within the used vehicle market; andWHEREAS, Used vehicle buyers would also benefit from the same fuel savings and reduced costs as new vehicle buyers, while avoiding many of the up-front costs associated with improvements in technology that are typically passed on to purchasers of new vehicles; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the House of Representatives direct the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing a low-emission and zero-emission vehicle program in this Commonwealth and to issue a report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the study do the following:(1) identify and examine efforts, procedures, measures, 20250HR0082PN0684 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 statutes and management responsibilities of State agencies, nongovernmental organizations and academic institutions to assist in determining the feasibility of establishing a Statewide low-emission and zero-emission vehicle program;(2) conduct an economic impact analysis regarding the widespread use of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles in this Commonwealth;(3) identify best practices in regard to developing the necessary infrastructure to support the widespread use of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles in this Commonwealth; and(4) identify financial mechanisms and options for funding the development of a Statewide low-emission and zero-emission vehicle program and related infrastructure in this Commonwealth;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission consult with organizations that:(1) have organizational missions and expertise regarding air quality, auto manufacturing, the economy, the environment, health and safety, transportation and both rural and urban affairs;(2) collect data on the benefits that low-emission and zero-emission vehicles may have in regard to air quality, auto manufacturing, the economy, the environment, health and safety, transportation and both rural and urban affairs; and(3) have knowledge of relevant issues;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission be authorized to consult with states and other organizations that 20250HR0082PN0684 - 4 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 have knowledge of relevant issues; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission issue a report of its findings and recommendations and submit the report to the Governor and the General Assembly no later than 18 months after the adoption of this resolution.20250HR0082PN0684 - 5 - 12345
