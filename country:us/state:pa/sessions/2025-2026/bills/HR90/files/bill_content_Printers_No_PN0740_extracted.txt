2025-2026 Regular Session HR 90 PN 0740 Bill Text (HTM) See other bills under thesame topic PRINTER'S NO. 740 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIAHOUSE RESOLUTION No.90 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY WEBSTER, MALAGARI, WAXMAN, HILL-EVANS, PIELLI, MADDEN, FREEMAN, OTTEN, MAYES, SANCHEZ, SCHLOSSBERG AND HOWARD, FEBRUARY 24, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION, FEBRUARY 24, 2025 A RESOLUTIONDirecting the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study on the projected costs in Pennsylvania of climate change adaptation and resilience measures needed to mitigate the projected impacts of certain climate-change-related events.WHEREAS, Weather and climate disasters, which can include events such as winter storms, wildfire events, tornado outbreaks, heat and cold wave events, tropical cyclones, droughts, flooding events and hail events, cause extreme damage across the United States every year; andWHEREAS, Calendar year 2023 had the largest number of billion-dollar disasters in United States history; andWHEREAS, In 2023, the cost of the damage caused by climate and weather disasters in the United States was at least $92.9 billion, with 28 separate weather and climate events costing at least $1 billion each; andWHEREAS, Increasing global temperatures are resulting in higher intensity and more frequent hurricanes, droughts and heat 123456789101112131415161718 waves and are changing precipitation patterns and the length of wildfire seasons; andWHEREAS, Experts predict that the cost of climate change adaptations will cost Pennsylvanians at least $15 billion by 2040, which will stem from the need to adjust to increased precipitation and flooding, as well as the need to adapt to higher temperatures; andWHEREAS, This Commonwealth's already-deteriorating infrastructure will experience exacerbated deterioration due to climate change; andWHEREAS, Pennsylvanians who are low-income, rural or a part of vulnerable populations will be especially susceptible to the impact of climate change; andWHEREAS, Climate change impacts vital Commonwealth industries, namely agriculture, with changing and intensifying weather patterns that threaten the livelihoods of farmers; andWHEREAS, As current climate and weather disasters are already resulting in human migration, worsening climate change is predicted to increase human migration as the frequency of climate and weather disasters intensifies; andWHEREAS, It is in the best interest of the House of Representatives to be prepared for the consequences of climate change in order to successfully preserve and protect this Commonwealth's people, environment and infrastructure; andWHEREAS, The Shared Socioeconomic Pathway and the Representative Concentration Pathway are climate modeling tools that can be used to predict how the climate might change in the future and how those changes could impact global society, demographics and economics; andWHEREAS, With these tools, scientists can make predictions 20250HR0090PN0740 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 about the potential cost of adapting to a planet heavily impacted by climate change; andWHEREAS, Analyzing and evaluating climate risk will allow the House of Representatives to be better prepared for future severe weather events and the cost of climate change; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the House of Representatives direct the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a comprehensive study on the projected costs in Pennsylvania of climate change adaptation and resilience measures and the cost of the impact of climate change on the public health and well-being of Pennsylvanians and the natural, built and social environments of Pennsylvania; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission study shall utilize either the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways or Representative Concentration Pathways as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to study the climate change adaptation and resilience measures needed to mitigate the projected impacts for at least two different future scenarios; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the study must identify what research, data, modeling, stakeholder engagement and other resources are needed in order to:(1) Estimate costs for mid-century, late-century and end-of-century, using 2024 dollars as a baseline.(2) Estimate costs related to hazards, including, but not limited to, precipitation and heat and the impacts of precipitation and heat on soil and lakes.(3) Provide an analysis of the projected costs and impacts of additional hazards like flooding, drought, sea level rise, wildfires, high-wind events, extreme cold and 20250HR0090PN0740 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 vector-borne illnesses.(4) Provide analyses of how these hazards and impacts are experienced differently by Pennsylvanians based on demographics, including race, gender, ability and age, as well as economic status and geography.(5) Identify methods for understanding and making decisions about the trade-offs between the financial and social costs to mitigate climate risks and the level of risk reduction achieved;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the study must also identify what research, data, modeling, stakeholder engagement and other resources are needed in order to estimate the costs of climate change impacts on:(1) This Commonwealth's natural environment, including impacts on:(i) Working lands and natural lands.(ii) Water, including surface waters, tidal waters, rivers, drinking water and Lake Erie.(iii) Air, including, but not limited to, surface temperature and air quality.(iv) The biodiversity of this Commonwealth's biomes.(2) This Commonwealth's built environment, including impacts on:(i) Residential, commercial and public buildings.(ii) Critical infrastructure, including the infrastructure that manages storm water, wastewater, drinking water, transportation, electricity, gas and communications technologies.(3) This Commonwealth's social environment, including 20250HR0090PN0740 - 4 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 impacts on:(i) Human settlement and migration.(ii) Statewide and regional economies, including impacts on industries like recreation, tourism, agriculture and forest products.(iii) Public health, including impacts related to emergency response, asthma, heat exposure and vector-borne illnesses;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That, to prepare the study, the Joint State Government Commission shall engage subject-area experts and other stakeholders, as needed, to contribute to the study; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission issue a report with its findings and recommendations no later than 12 months after the adoption of this resolution to the following:(1) The President pro tempore of the Senate.(2) The Speaker of the House of Representatives.(3) The Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the Senate.(4) The Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.(5) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate.(6) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives.(7) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee of the Senate.(8) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee of 20250HR0090PN0740 - 5 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 the House of Representatives.(9) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Finance Committee of the Senate.(10) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives.(11) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Health and Human Services Committee of the Senate.(12) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Health Committee of the House of Representatives.(13) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Transportation Committee of the Senate.(14) The chairperson and minority chairperson of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives.20250HR0090PN0740 - 6 - 12345678910111213
