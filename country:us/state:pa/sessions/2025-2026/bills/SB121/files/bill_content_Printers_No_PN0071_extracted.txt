Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Center for Gun Violence Research Act.Section 2. Findings.The General Assembly finds and declares the following:(1) Gun violence is a significant public health crisis and public safety problem in this Commonwealth and nationwide. Nationally, rates of fatal gun violence have remained essentially unchanged for more than a decade, as declines in homicide have been offset by increases in suicide.(2) For the decade ending in 2010, Pennsylvania had 12,941 gun-related deaths, which ranked fourth highest in the United States. During that same decade, the rate of gun 123456789101112131415161718 homicides among children and teenagers in this Commonwealth ranked as one of the highest in the nation.(3) The annual cost of gun violence across the United States is estimated to be more than $100,000,000,000 and could be as high as $229,000,000,000 per year.(4) Too little is known about gun violence, its causes and the best practices for its prevention. There is a substantial need for publicly funded academic research in gun violence. The need for more research and more sophisticated research is critical in fighting the plague of gun violence in our schools and communities.(5) Federal funding for gun violence research through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was effectively eliminated by Congress in 1996 through the passage of a provision known as the Dickey Amendment.(6) It is the intent of this act to provide State funding for gun violence research in place of the Federal funding that has been curtailed by the Dickey Amendment.Section 3. Definitions.The following words and phrases when used in this act shall have the meanings given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:"Center."
