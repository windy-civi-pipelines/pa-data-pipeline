2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 continue to live in the community rather than an institution; andWHEREAS, In 1978, the Congress of the United States defined developmental disability as a severe, chronic disability due to a physical or mental impairment, manifesting before 22 years of age, likely to continue indefinitely, and resulting in substantial functional limitations in three or more major life activities; andWHEREAS, This definition was updated in 2000 by the Developmental Disabilities and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, emphasizing the need for lifelong, individualized support; andWHEREAS, Pennsylvania has adopted eligibility criteria for Home and Community-Based Services waivers that exclude some individuals who meet the Federal definition of developmental disability, thus preventing them from receiving the necessary services; andWHEREAS, Inadequate service availability and provision can detrimentally affect an individual's health, ability to live independently, work and have self-determined lives; andWHEREAS, Data submitted by the Department of Human Services to the Employment First Oversight Commission shows that in 2022, 16% of ODP's Home and Community-Based Services waiver participants 18 to 64 years of age are employed in an integrated setting and earning a minimum wage or higher; andWHEREAS, Supporting access to Home and Community-Based Services waivers, medical assistance and other public assistance is important to the Commonwealth's commitment to health equality and equal participation in our communities; andWHEREAS, The concerns and needs of the individuals who use these programs should be the foremost priority for legislators 20250HR0010PN0146 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 in delivering assistance to those individuals; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the House of Representatives direct the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study and issue a report on the programs administered by the Office of Long-Term Living and the Office of Developmental Programs focused on how to improve the experience of individuals with disabilities that receive a Home and Community-Based Services waiver; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the study:(1) Report on whether Home and Community-Based Services waivers meet the medical needs of recipients who have a disability, and ways in which care under waivers can be improved to better meet the medical needs of individuals with disabilities, taking into consideration those differences in the needs of individuals with physical disabilities and developmental disabilities.(2) Examine and compare the rates being paid by the OLTL's waivers and programs such as Community HealthChoices, OBRA and Act 150 Services, and ODP's waivers for caregiver services, employment support services and participant-driven services.(3) Examine the service menus in the OLTL versus those in ODP, recognizing that the needs of individuals in both programs may be the same or similar.(4) Examine challenges faced by waiver participants to avoid institutionalization and to be supported to remain actively engaged in their community.(5) Examine the root causes of the percentages of OLTL participants in competitive integrated employment being one-tenth of those served by ODP's waivers.20250HR0010PN0146 -
