Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Commercial/Industrial Rooftop Solar Act.Section 2. Definitions.The following words and phrases when used in this act shall have the meanings given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:"Commercial/industrial rooftop." The rooftop of any building that is a nonresidential building."Commercial/industrial rooftop solar project." A solar energy generation system with a nameplate capacity of not larger than three megawatts as measured in alternating current located 1234567891011121314151617 on a commercial/industrial rooftop."Commercial/industrial rooftop solar project generator." A nonutility owner or operator of a commercial/industrial rooftop solar project."Commission." The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission."Electric distribution company" or "EDC."
