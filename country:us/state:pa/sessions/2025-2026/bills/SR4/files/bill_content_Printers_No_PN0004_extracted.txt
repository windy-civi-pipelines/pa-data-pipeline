Official action would relate to a Senator's lawmaking duties especially as that relates to legislation and confirmations.(e) Required filing for recommendations.--A financial interest statement must be filed if a Senate employee's responsibility includes making a recommendation to a Senator as to any of the following:(1) Advice regarding how to vote on the Floor or in Committee.(2) The potential consideration of bills, resolutions, amendments to bills or resolutions or nominations in Committee.(3) The drafting and preparation of legislation or resolutions, and any amendments to bills or resolutions, including advice on decisions regarding bill or resolution sponsorships.(f) Applicability.--The requirement to file a financial interest statement shall apply to executive directors, counsels or any Senate employee responsible for a Committee and to Senate chiefs of staff.

In most cases, a Senate employee with job responsibilities not directly related to the actual lawmaking process, such as correspondence or scheduling, does not need to file a financial interest statement.(h) District office.--A Senate employee assigned to a district office shall be subject to the same filing requirements as a Harrisburg-based Senate employee depending on the nature of that individual's employment responsibilities.Rule 7. Training.To assure compliance with these rules and other laws related to ethical behavior by Senators and Senate employees, appropriate training measures shall be implemented by the Senate. Training shall be provided annually for all Senators and Senate employees on various topics, which shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:(1) These rules.(2) The Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S. Ch. 11 (relating to ethics standards and financial disclosure).(3) 65 Pa.C.S. Ch. 13A (relating to lobbying disclosure).Rule 8. Rules.(a) Force and effect.--These Rules shall be in full force and effect until altered, changed, amended or repealed as provided in subsection (c).(b) Voting for altering, changing or amending rules.--The consent of a majority of the Senators elected shall be necessary to alter, change or amend these Rules.(c) Alteration, change or amendment of rules by resolution.--All alterations, changes or amendments to Senate 20250SR0004PN0004 - 32 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Rules shall be by resolution which shall not be considered unless first referred to and reported from the Rules Committee.20250SR0004PN0004 - 33 - 12

Any time period required for any actions of the Committee or others under this rule shall be tolled until the reconstituted Committee has made a determination whether or not to proceed.

The opinion shall be issued within 14 days following the request. No member who acts in good faith on an opinion issued under this paragraph shall be subject to any sanctions for so acting if the material facts are as stated in the request.

Within 15 days after receipt of the letter, the subject may file a written response with the Committee. Failure of the subject to file a response shall not be deemed to be an admission, or create an inference or presumption, that the allegations in the complaint are true, and such failure shall not prohibit the Committee from either proceeding with the preliminary or a formal investigation or dismissing the complaint. The Committee may engage 20250SR0004PN0004 - 16 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 independent counsel to assist in a preliminary investigation.

The adjustments may include:(i) removing the complainant or the subject from the physical work location of the complainant;(ii) allowing the complainant to be placed on administrative leave with continued pay and benefits, ifapplicable; or(iii) any other reasonable accommodation agreed to by the employer and the complainant.(14) The employer shall keep the letter and the fact of the initiation of a preliminary investigation confidential but may disclose necessary information to members, officers of the Senate or Senate employees as needed in order to implement the foregoing adjustments. No Senate employee shall retaliate or take adverse actions against the complainant in response to the filing of a complaint of a violation of Rule 3 with the Committee.(15) A member of the Committee who is the complainant, the subject or a witness to the unethical conduct or 20250SR0004PN0004 - 17 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 violation alleged in a complaint shall not participate in any Committee consideration of the complaint. The member shall be temporarily replaced on the Committee in a like manner as the member's original appointment.(16) Within 30 days following the initiation of a preliminary investigation, the Committee shall vote to dismiss the complaint for lack of probable cause to support the alleged unethical conduct or violation or to proceed with a formal investigation because it finds that probable cause exists. If a majority of the Committee is unable to agree on either course of action, the Committee shall dismiss the complaint. The Committee shall promptly notify the complainant and the subject in writing of the result.(17) If the Committee votes to proceed with a formal investigation, the Committee shall engage independent counsel unless the Committee determines that the alleged unethical conduct or violation raised in the complaint does not warrant the expense of engaging independent counsel.

Subpoenas shall be served by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate or another person designated by the Committee when directed to do so by the Committee. Each subpoena shall be addressed to the witness and shall state that such proceeding is before a Committee of the Senate for which the witness is required to attend and testify at a specified time and place; or to produce books, papers, records, accounts, reports, documents and data and information produced and stored by any 20250SR0004PN0004 - 19 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 electronic data processing system; or both, as the Committee may also require.

Only findings and recommendations agreed to by a majority of the Committee shall be included in the report. The report may include a minority report. The Senate shall not take any action on the findings and recommendations submitted by the Committee and shall not make such findings and recommendations public until a period of at least seven days has passed following the Committee's provision of the report to the subject and complainant.(31) The Committee may extend any of the time periods, other than those relating to the jurisdiction of the Committee, required for any actions of the Committee or others under this rule.(32) Investigations, hearings and meetings of the Committee relating to an investigation and the existence of such investigations, hearings and meetings shall not be open 20250SR0004PN0004 - 22 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 to the public and shall be confidential. All other meetings of the Committee shall be open to the public.(33) Notwithstanding the above, except for a hearing on complaints of a violation of Rule 3, the Committee shall conduct a hearing in public upon the written request of the subject unless the Committee determines that evidence or testimony to be received at the hearing may substantially defame, degrade, or incriminate a person other than the subject. In that event, the Committee shall receive such evidence or testimony in executive session. No evidence or testimony taken in executive session may be released to any person or authority or used in public sessions without the consent of the Committee.(34) The Committee may enter into a consent agreement with the subject at any point in the proceedings.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, 20250SR0004PN0004 - 24 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 a member who is the subject of a complaint of a violation of Rule 3 filed with the Committee shall not benefit from a nondisclosure agreement or provision if a completed formal investigation of the Committee finds that the complaint is credible or a final decision by the Committee finds a violation.(39) The Committee may meet with a committee of the House to hold investigations or hearings involving complaints against employees of the two chambers jointly or officers or employees of the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Joint State Government Commission, the Local Government Commission, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, the Legislative Data Processing Committee or other legislative service agencies.
