WILLIAMS, GREEN, CIRESI, SHUSTERMAN, FREEMAN, PROBST, POWELL, MULLINS, ECKER, K.HARRIS, MERSKI AND ABNEY, APRIL 16, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, APRIL 16, 2025 AN ACTAmending the act of November 24, 1976 (P.L.1176, No.261), entitled "An act providing for the rights and duties of manufactured home owners or operators and manufactured home lessees," providing for resident associations and group meetings; further providing for disclosure of fees; providing for reasonable increases in rent and fees and for justified rent increase to support extraordinary increases in operating expenses; and further providing for damages.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. The General Assembly recognizes the following public policy purposes and declares that the following objectives of the Commonwealth are to be served by this act:(1) Pennsylvania faces a significant shortage of affordable housing units that contributes to higher rates of homelessness and housing instability, impacting the well-being of many residents.(2) The lack of affordable housing also affects this Commonwealth's economic competitiveness and educational and 12345678910111213141516171819 health outcomes.(3) Manufactured homes are a vital part of the affordable housing market because buying a manufactured home remains a relatively affordable alternative to purchasing a higher-cost traditional home.(4) Manufactured home communities in this Commonwealth are home to many low-income to moderate-income individuals and families.(5) Homes in manufactured home communities, however, are subject to lot leases with ever-increasing rents determined by the landowner who controls the land on which the homes sit.(6) It is difficult and expensive to move a manufactured home once it has been set on a foundation making the residents of manufactured home communities especially vulnerable to exploitation.(7) For manufactured home community owners, the difficulty residents face in moving their homes means a consistent source of revenue, including during economic downturns.(8) Large corporations and private equity firms have been buying up manufactured home communities in this Commonwealth, leading to resident complaints of drastic increases in lot rents, a lack of onsite management and a lack of repairs.(9) Unlike traditional homes which appreciate over time, the value of manufactured homes decreases over time and this decrease can be accelerated by predatory lot rent increases disguised as necessary improvements.(10) Homeowners who are unable to pay unaffordable rent 20250HB1250PN1379 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 increases face eviction and the loss of their home due to the high cost and extreme difficulty of moving it.(11) Homeowners who are able to remain struggle to pay the increased rent and are often faced with deteriorating living conditions and a loss of value in their homes.(12) The public good and the general welfare of the residents of this Commonwealth require the exercise of the police powers of the Commonwealth to regulate lot rents in manufactured home communities.(13) Regulating lot rents in manufactured home communities is a valid means of exercising the police powers of the Commonwealth to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of this Commonwealth and safeguard vulnerable residents of manufactured home communities from exploitation.(14) Regulating lot rents in manufactured home communities by providing for reasonable annual lot rent increases up to the average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Northeast Region, for the most recently available 12-month period, but no less than 2% nor more than 4%, with exceptions for extraordinary increases in operating expenses, ensures that landowners can get a fair return on their investment.(15) Regulating lot rents in manufactured home communities by providing for reasonable annual lot rent increases up to the average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Northeast Region, for the most recently available 12-month period, but no less than 2% nor more than 4%, with exceptions for extraordinary increases in operating expenses, is not unreasonable, unduly burdensome 20250HB1250PN1379 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 or patently beyond what is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of this Commonwealth and safeguard vulnerable residents of manufactured home communities from exploitation.(16) Prohibiting landowners from increasing the lot rent during the pendency of an unresolved health or safety violation, except under conditions designed to ensure the correction of all health or safety violations, is a valid means of exercising the police powers of the Commonwealth to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of this Commonwealth and safeguard vulnerable residents of manufactured home communities from exploitation. (17) With stable land tenure and prohibition against predatory rent practices, a manufactured home becomes a wealth-building asset for a family, and residents are more likely to become active stakeholders in the improvement and upkeep of their community.Section 2. The act of November 24, 1976 (P.L.1176, No.261), known as the Manufactured Home Community Rights Act, is amended by adding a section to read:Section 4.2. Resident Associations and Group Meetings.--(a) A manufactured home community owner may not prohibit or interfere with the operation of a resident association.(b) A manufactured home community owner shall allow group meetings on site between residents without any limitations related to the number of residents, location of the meetings and the timing of meetings.Section 3.

Increases in such rent, fees, service charges and assessments payable to the owner shall be unenforceable until [30] 90 days after notice thereof has been posted in the public portion of the community office or other conspicuous and readily accessible place in the manufactured home community and mailed to the manufactured home lessee.
