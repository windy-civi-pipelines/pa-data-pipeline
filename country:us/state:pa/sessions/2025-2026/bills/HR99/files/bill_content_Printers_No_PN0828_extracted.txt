MILLER, D. WILLIAMS, WARREN, WEBSTER, CEPEDA-FREYTIZ, KHAN, MADDEN AND WAXMAN, MARCH 3, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY, MARCH 3, 2025 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONDirecting the Joint State Government Commission to establish a bipartisan task force to study any consolidated or unconsolidated State statutes in the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, Judicial Code, Sentencing Code or elsewhere under which a term of imprisonment and other collateral consequences may be imposed in order to identify redundant, overlapping and inconsistent offenses, improper grading and gaps in criminal liability, out-of-date, antiquated, offensive or unenforceable language and to make recommendations to the General Assembly.WHEREAS, In 1972, the General Assembly enacted the Crimes Code in Title 18 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, which contained 282 carefully considered offenses and suboffenses; andWHEREAS, Since the Crimes Code's enactment, it has expanded more than fivefold and now contains more than 1,500 offenses and suboffenses, the majority of which were created without a thorough review of the entire Crimes Code; andWHEREAS, According to a 2009 report on offense grading jointly commissioned by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and 123456789101112131415161718192021 authored by Professor Paul H. Robinson as well as the University of Pennsylvania's Criminal Law Research Group, this ad hoc expansion of the Crimes Code has resulted in a "system of offenses marked by irrational and contradictory grading differences, and offense grades that seriously conflict with the values of Pennsylvania residents" in addition to various overlapping and duplicative offenses; andWHEREAS, The addition of numerous new offenses and changes to the Crimes Code since the publication of the 2009 report has not only exacerbated the issues identified in the report but has also extended to new, inconsistent and outdated provisions in our Commonwealth's Judicial Code and Sentencing Code, as well as other statutes, consolidated or otherwise, for which a term of imprisonment and other collateral consequences may be imposed; andWHEREAS, A rational crimes code with offenses that coincide with the views of the residents of this Commonwealth, in conjunction with a cohesive Sentencing Code and a consistent Judicial Code, is necessary to build and sustain public trust in the laws of this Commonwealth and in the interpretation of those laws by the judiciary; andWHEREAS, The ever-increasing size and scope of the Crimes Code has made it difficult for legislators to identify and remedy gaps in criminal liability within the Crimes Code; andWHEREAS, The convoluted nature of the Crimes Code has also made it difficult for residents to fully comprehend the offenses and grades within the code; andWHEREAS, This is contrary to the goal of the Crimes Code, which is to provide the public with a clear and comprehensible list of prohibited activities and their punishments; and20250HR0099PN0828 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 WHEREAS, A cohesive and rational Crimes Code, Judicial Code and Sentencing Code would be advantageous for the residents of this Commonwealth and every constituency working within the criminal justice process as it would serve to reduce confusion and provide a consistent approach to crime and punishment and any attendant penalties contained in statutes that include offenses for which a term of imprisonment and other collateral consequences are possible outcomes; andWHEREAS, Eliminating or updating out-of-date, antiquated, offensive or unenforceable language from all provisions of Pennsylvania's Crimes Code, Judicial Code and Sentencing Code, as well as any consolidated or unconsolidated statutes that could result in imprisonment and other collateral consequences, would finally modernize the language of our codes, thereby ensuring that the State laws reflect the views of the residents in this Commonwealth consistently and unequivocally; andWHEREAS, The General Assembly should be knowledgeable about the state and nature of the Crimes Code and aware of any oversights, deficiencies and redundancies within the Code that would best be resolved; therefore be itRESOLVED (the Senate concurring), That the General Assembly direct the Joint State Government Commission to establish a bipartisan task force to study any consolidated or unconsolidated State statutes in the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, Judicial Code, Sentencing Code or elsewhere under which a term of imprisonment and other collateral consequences may be imposed in order to identify redundant, overlapping and inconsistent offenses, improper grading and gaps in criminal liability, out-of-date, antiquated, offensive or unenforceable language and to make recommendations to the General Assembly;
