Grant of limited contact to nonparent.On motion of a deploying parent, and in accordance with law of this Commonwealth other than this chapter, unless a court finds that limited contact would be contrary to the best interest of the child, the court shall grant limited contact to a nonparent who is an individual with whom the child has a close and substantial relationship.§ 4629. Nature of authority created by order.(a) Duration and effect.--A grant of authority under this subchapter is temporary and terminates under Subchapter D (relating to return from deployment) after the return from deployment of the deploying parent unless the grant has been terminated before that time by court order. The grant does not create an independent, continuing right to caretaking authority, legal custody or limited contact in an individual to whom it is granted.(b) Standing.--A nonparent granted caretaking authority, legal custody or limited contact under this subchapter has standing to enforce the grant until it is terminated by court order.§ 4630.
