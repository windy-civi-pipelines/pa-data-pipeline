2025-2026 Regular Session HR 327 PN 2351 Bill Text (HTM) PRINTER'S NO. 2351 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIAHOUSE RESOLUTION No.327 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY GREEN, HILL-EVANS, KHAN, GIRAL, PROBST, PIELLI, HOWARD, SCHLOSSBERG, VITALI, CIRESI, SANCHEZ, SHUSTERMAN, PASHINSKI, O'MARA AND RABB, SEPTEMBER 26, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AFFAIRS, SEPTEMBER 29, 2025 A RESOLUTIONDirecting the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study evaluating the feasibility of a multifaceted approach to decreasing food waste given this Commonwealth's current infrastructure.WHEREAS, Food waste is defined as a decrease of food in stages of the supply chain intended for human consumption; andWHEREAS, The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that 30% to 40% of the food supply in the United States is wasted; andWHEREAS, The amount of food wasted every year is approximately 92 billion pounds, representing roughly 145 billion meals' worth of food annually; andWHEREAS, The PA Waste Characterization Study, published in 2022, revealed that food waste was 17%, or 1,593,109 tons, of the waste in this Commonwealth's waste stream on an annual basis and that edible food comprises over 72% of total food waste; andWHEREAS, Americans throw away approximately $473 billion in food every year, including food at retailers, restaurants and at 123456789101112131415161718 home; andWHEREAS, Food waste accounts for approximately 24% of landfill weight at landfills; andWHEREAS, Methane is released when food breaks down in landfills, which is a greenhouse gas that is more than 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide; andWHEREAS, This Commonwealth's Statewide network of nonprofit regional food banks, and the nearly 3,000 local food assistance agencies they serve, work to reduce food waste by rescuing surplus foods from manufacturers, retailers and farms; andWHEREAS, This Commonwealth benefits from several successful food rescue programs designed to reduce waste by moving food to individuals facing hunger; andWHEREAS, This Commonwealth is home to thousands of livestock farms, many of which already accept donations of food for animal consumption; andWHEREAS, Food recycling methods like composting or anaerobic digestion can help in reducing the harmful impacts of food waste; andWHEREAS, Composting can turn what would ordinarily be food waste into plant and soil amendment for trees and shrubs or mixed in as topsoil, helping with water retention and providing valuable nutrients for plant life; andWHEREAS, Anaerobic digestion, which is the method of controlling the breakdown of food waste by microorganisms, releases a biogas from which methane can be extracted and used to power engines, run alternative fuel vehicles and supply homes and businesses through natural gas pipelines; andWHEREAS, Food waste being repurposed and recycled for other uses has both positive environmental and economic impacts and 20250HR0327PN2351 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 should be studied; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the House of Representatives direct the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study evaluating the feasibility of a multifaceted approach to decreasing food waste given this Commonwealth's current infrastructure, including:(1) incentivizing additional food rescue operations to enable safe and wholesome food to be eaten by individuals;(2) incentivizing collection of food no longer marketable to individuals for consumption by livestock to be composted instead of landfilled;(3) when and if no other option is available, incentivizing the disposal of food at anaerobic digestion facilities permitted to accept food waste; and(4) requiring food waste recycling by businesses and individuals within this Commonwealth given the current infrastructure;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission develop a report of the results of the study in collaboration with the:(1) Department of Agriculture;(2) Department of Environmental Protection;(3) at least one nonprofit organization currently engaged in food rescue operations; and(4) at least one business engaged in composting or biodigestion;and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission provide recommendations necessary or desirable for ways to improve this Commonwealth's infrastructure for reducing food waste, including a comparative cost analysis of compost versus landfilling 20250HR0327PN2351 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 organic waste and recommendations, including, but not limited to, lowering financial barriers to compost, including consideration of increasing the cost of landfilling; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the Joint State Government Commission issue a report of the results of the study and recommendations evaluating this Commonwealth's physical and human infrastructure for reducing food waste and file the report with the House of Representatives no later than one year after adoption of this resolution.20250HR0327PN2351 - 4 - 12345678910
