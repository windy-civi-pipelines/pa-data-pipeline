A Pennsylvania sheriff, the Constitutional officers responsible for county law enforcement."Solar radiation modification" or "sunlight reflection method." An experiment in the Earth's climatic system involving the release of pollutants that reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. The term includes the use of interoperable, ground-based, airborne and space-based facilities."Weather engineering." The deliberate manipulation of the environment for purposes that include changing the weather or climate by artificial means, typically involving the release of pollutants into the atmosphere via cloud seeding, for small-20250HB1167PN1293 - 4 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 scale, large-scale and global-scale alteration of the environment."Weather modification." Changing, controlling or interfering with or attempting to alter, change, control or interfere with the natural development of cloud forms, precipitation, barometric pressure, temperature, conductivity or other electromagnetic or sonic characteristics of the atmosphere.Section 3. Prohibited activity.The Pennsylvania State Police or a sheriff shall immediately issue a cease-and-desist order when cloud seeding or polluting atmospheric intervention is suspected. The cease-and-desist order under this section shall have the weight of a court order and any violation shall be punished in accordance with section 5.Section 4. Notice to cease Federal or foreign-approved programs.(a) Notice.--Government and armed forces projects must meet all the requirements of this act. If an activity deemed hazardous by this act has been approved, explicitly or implicitly, by the Federal Government, the Pennsylvania State Police or a sheriff shall issue a notice to the appropriate Federal agency that the activity cannot lawfully be carried out within or over this Commonwealth.(b) Implementation.--The Pennsylvania State Police or a sheriff is authorized to and shall implement this act, determining whether violations have occurred and, if deemed necessary, shall refer potentially prohibited activity to the Air National Guard.Section 5.
