The person liable to make the return under section 2136 may elect to have the tax computed as if the decedent was a resident and his entire estate was property having its situs in this Commonwealth, and the tax due shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to the tax thus computed as the real property and tangible personal property located in this Commonwealth bears to the entire estate of the decedent.(b.1) The inheritance tax due upon the transfer of property passing to or for the use of a husband or wife shall be the lesser of the tax imposed under subsection (a)(1.1) or the tax due after the allowance of the credit provided for under section 2112.(c) When any person entitled to a distributive share of an estate, whether under an inter vivos trust, a will or the intestate law, renounces his right to receive the distributive share receiving therefor no consideration, or exercises his elective rights under 20 Pa.C.S.

Notice of the filing of the account and of its call for audit or confirmation shall include notice to the department.(e) If the rate of tax which will be applicable when an interest vests in possession and enjoyment cannot be established with certainty, the department, after consideration of relevant actuarial factors, valuations and other pertinent circumstances, may enter into an agreement with the person responsible for 20250HB1394PN1589 - 22 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 payment to establish a specified amount of tax which, when paid within sixty days after the agreement, shall constitute full payment of all tax otherwise due upon such transfer.

Estate Tax.--(a) In the event that a Federal estate tax is payable to the Federal Government on the transfer of the taxable estate of a decedent who was a resident of this Commonwealth at the time of his death, and the inheritance tax, if any, actually paid to the Commonwealth by reason of the death of the decedent (disregarding interest or the amount of any discount allowed under section 2142) is less than the maximum credit for State death taxes allowable under section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99-514, 26 U.S.C. § 2011), a tax equal to the difference is imposed. If a resident decedent owned or had an interest in real property or tangible personal property having a situs in another state, the tax so imposed shall be reduced by the greater of:(1) the amount of death taxes actually paid to the other state with respect to the estate of the decedent, excluding any death tax expressly imposed to receive the benefit of the credit for state death taxes allowed under section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. § 2011); or(2) an amount computed by multiplying the maximum credit for state death taxes allowable under section 2011 of the Internal 20250HB1394PN1589 - 23 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. § 2011) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the real property and tangible personal property to the extent included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes and having a situs in the other state and the denominator of which is the value of the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes.(b) In the event that a Federal estate tax is payable to the Federal Government on the transfer of the taxable estate of a decedent who was not a resident of this Commonwealth at the time of his death but who owned or had an interest in real property or tangible personal property having a situs in this Commonwealth, a tax is imposed in an amount computed by multiplying the maximum credit for State death taxes allowable under section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. § 2011) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the real property and tangible personal property to the extent included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes having a situs in this Commonwealth and the denominator of which is the value of the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes, and deducting from that amount the inheritance tax, if any, actually paid to the Commonwealth (disregarding interest or the amount of any discount allowed under section 2142).(c) When an inheritance tax is imposed after an estate tax imposed under subsection (a) or (b) has been paid, the estate tax paid shall be credited against any inheritance tax later imposed.PART VVALUATION20250HB1394PN1589 - 24 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Section 2121.

If the option or agreement is not exercised and consummated, the value at which the property is appraised shall not be limited to the established price payable for the property, and it shall not exceed the value of the property on the date of the transferor's death.

In the event the aggregate amount payable under the agreement to the states involved is less than the maximum credit allowable to the estate against the Federal estate tax imposed with respect to the estate, the personal representatives shall also pay to the department so much of the difference between the aggregate amount and the amount of such credit as the amount payable to the department under the agreement bears to the aggregate amount. A copy of the agreement shall be filed in the office of the proper register, and any existing appraisement shall be deemed modified according to the agreement.

The executor or administrator of the decedent is authorized to make the agreement. The parties to the agreement shall select the arbitrator or arbitrators.Section 2159. Arbitration Board.--(a) The board shall have the power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents and issue commissions to take testimony.

Interest or Penalties for Nonpayment of Taxes.--In any case where it is determined by the board that the decedent died domiciled in this Commonwealth, interest or penalties, if otherwise imposed by law, for nonpayment of inheritance taxes between the date of the agreement and of filing of the determination of the board as to domicile shall not exceed the rate provided for in section 2143.Section 2162. Compromise by Parties to Arbitration Agreement.--The provisions of this part shall not prevent at any time a written compromise, if otherwise lawful, by all parties to the agreement made pursuant to section 2157, fixing the amounts to be accepted by this Commonwealth and any other state 20250HB1394PN1589 - 51 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 involved in full satisfaction of inheritance taxes.Section 2163.
