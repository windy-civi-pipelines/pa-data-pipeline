If so paid, there shall be no interest or penalty; if not so paid, there shall be added to such amount five per centum thereof and, in addition, interest at the rate of one-half of one per centum per month for each month or fraction thereof from the date of such notice to the date of payment.

Estimated Assessment.--(a) If any person believed by the department to be liable for tax under the provisions of this act shall have failed to file a return in accordance with and within the time prescribed by this act, and if the department shall deem it more conducive to the public interest because of the supposed smallness of the tax or for any other reason not to proceed to compel the exhibition of the accounts of such person, it may make an estimated assessment of the probable amount of tax owing by such person; but in every such case the department shall add to such estimated assessment a penalty of fifty per centum (50%) thereof and the department 20250HB1005PN1092 - 11 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 shall proceed to collect such estimated tax and penalty as in other cases if the amount is not paid when due as hereinafter provided.(b) The estimated assessment thus determined, together with the penalty of fifty per centum (50%) specified above and interest at the rate of one-half of one per centum per month or fractional part thereof until paid, shall be due and payable ten days after notice of such settlement shall have been mailed by the department to the person against whom the estimated assessment has been made.Section 404. Limitation of Assessments.--(a) Any additional assessment or estimated assessment shall be made by the department within five years of the date when the return required by section three hundred one or authorized by section three hundred two hereof should have been filed, as prescribed in this act, whether the date originally prescribed or pursuant to any extensions of the time for filing such return duly granted by the department and not after. Any such additional assessment or estimated assessment may be made at any time during such period, notwithstanding that the department may have made one or more previous additional assessments or estimated assessments or both against the taxpayer for the year in question or for any part of such year. In any such case, no credit shall be given for any penalty previously assessed or paid.(b) If the taxpayer shall have died, any taxes, interest and penalties due under this act for years prior to his death or for the year of his death and whether based on original assessments, additional or estimated assessments or otherwise, may be presented by the department at audit of his estate in the 20250HB1005PN1092 - 12 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 orphans' court.

A petition for reassessment, if filed, shall set forth explicitly and in detail the grounds upon which the taxpayer claims that the additional or estimated assessment is erroneous or unlawful, in whole or in part, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit under oath or affirmation certifying to the facts stated in the petition. If no petition for reassessment has been filed with the department but the taxpayer has given due notice of an intention to appear and be heard, the taxpayer may appear at the hearing and present his petition orally, in which event all statements of fact at the hearing shall be made under oath or affirmation.(b) Within sixty days after the date of mailing of notice by the department of the action taken on any petition for reassessment filed with it, the person against whom such assessment was made may by petition request the Board of Finance and Revenue to review such action.

If so paid, there shall be no interest or penalty; if not so paid, there shall be added to such amount five per centum thereof and, in addition, interest at the rate of one-half of one per centum per month for each month or fraction thereof from the date of such notice to the date of payment.

Any such additional assessment or estimated assessment may be made at any time during such period, notwithstanding that the department may have made one or more previous additional assessments or estimated assessments or both against the taxpayer for the year in question or for any part of such year. In any such case, no credit shall be given for any penalty previously assessed or paid.(b) If the taxpayer shall have died, any taxes, interest and penalties due under this act for years prior to his death or for the year of his death and whether based on original assessments, additional or estimated assessments or otherwise, may be presented by the department at audit of his estate in the 20250HB1005PN1092 - 12 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 orphans' court.
