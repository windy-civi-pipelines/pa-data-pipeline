The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate an action under subsection (b). No later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, the controller shall inform the consumer in writing of an action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reason for the decision.
