The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate an action under subsection (b). No later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, the controller shall inform the consumer in writing of an action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reason for the decision. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.Section 4.

The secure and reliable means shall include all of the following:(i) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's Internet website to an Internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of the consumer's personal data under section 3(a)(5).(ii) No later than January 1, 2027, allowing a consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for the purpose of targeted advertising or the sale of the consumer's personal data under section 3(a)(5) through an opt-out preference signal sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt out of the processing or sale.
