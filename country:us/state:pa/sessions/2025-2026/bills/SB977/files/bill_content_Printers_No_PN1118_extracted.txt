WARD, ROTHMAN, YAW AND CULVER, AUGUST 25, 2025 REFERRED TO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND PROFESSIONAL LICENSURE, AUGUST 25, 2025 AN ACTAmending Title 66 (Public Utilities) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, providing for consumer choice billing; imposing penalties; and making repeals.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. Title 66 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended by adding a chapter to read:CHAPTER 22ACONSUMER CHOICE BILLINGSec.22A01. Scope of chapter. 22A02. Declaration of policy.22A03. Definitions.22A04. Authorization of consumer choice billing.22A05. Implementation plans.22A06. Report.22A07. Penalties.§ 22A01. Scope of chapter. 123456789101112131415161718 This chapter provides for enhanced retail electric and natural gas competition through the adoption of electric and natural gas consumer choice billing and enhanced consumer protection regulations to be promulgated and enforced by the commission.§ 22A02. Declaration of policy.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) Reasonably priced reliable sources of electricity and natural gas generated and supplied in this Commonwealth are vital to the health, safety and welfare of this Commonwealth's residents, businesses and economy.(2) Numerous states, including this Commonwealth, have transitioned to a restructured energy market that has lowered the cost of electricity and natural gas and spurred technological and product innovations by authorizing competitive retail electric and natural gas supplier shopping.(3) The former provisions of 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives) and Chapters 22 (relating to natural gas competition) and 28 (relating to restructuring of electric utility industry) allow retail competition among electric and natural gas generation companies in order to lower consumer costs while maintaining regulation and supervision of electric and natural gas transmission and distribution services.(4) The year 2021 marked the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the former provisions of 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74, the 22nd anniversary of the enactment of the Natural Gas Choice and Competition Act and the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the Electricity Generation Customer Choice and Competition 20250SB0977PN1118 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Act, yet a ccording to utility shopping statistics released in January 2022 by the Office of Consumer Advocate, only 18.9% of residential electric consumers and 11.9% of residential natural gas consumers are served by an alternative service supplier, which is an indication that there is tremendous growth potential in this Commonwealth's residential electric and natural gas consumer market.(5) In markets where suppliers do not have access to smart meter data or the ability to render consolidated bills, consumers are restricted to one-size-fits-all rates, which provide limited benefits.(6) These basic rates may meet the needs of some consumers, but consolidated billing enables the development of pricing plans and offers that meet the unique needs of all consumers, including time-varying rates, demand response and renewable energy plans.(7) While this Commonwealth's consumers have invested billions of dollars into the deployment of more than 5,000,000 smart meters across this Commonwealth, regulated electric and natural gas distribution utilities have not capitalized on this consumer usage data to offer cost-effective and affordable time-of-use products to consumers.(8) Maintaining the status quo of retail electric and natural gas policies is not sound public policy given the turbulence in residential electric and natural gas rates and the historic public and private financial investments in this Commonwealth's ever-changing energy marketplace.(9) By allowing a direct relationship between retail electric and natural gas suppliers and consumers who choose to shop, consumer choice billing will enable suppliers to 20250SB0977PN1118 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 clarify their role with consumers, who may believe that they are only consumers of the utility regardless of their retail supplier, and solidify that role by providing the products and services the consumers desire.(10) The commission's mission is to balance the needs of consumers and utilities, ensure safe and reliable utility service, educate consumers on making independent and informed utility choices and to foster new technologies and competitive markets in an environmentally sound manner.(11) To achieve a fully functioning competitive electric and natural gas market in this Commonwealth, the commission has the legal and regulatory authority to promote and further incentivize the development of dynamic electric and natural gas supplier product offerings to consumers and improve utility consumer service through the adoption and regulation of consumer choice billing.§ 22A03.
