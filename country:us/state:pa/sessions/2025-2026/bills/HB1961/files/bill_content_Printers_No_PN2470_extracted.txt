PurposeIn order to strengthen access to Medical Services, and in 123456789101112131415161718 recognition of the advances in the delivery of Medical Services, the Participating States of the PA Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of State Licensing Boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a License to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of patients. This Compact allows Medical Services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the Licensee's Qualifying License by other Compact Participating States. This Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the State Licensing Board where the patient is located. State Licensing Boards that participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action against a Compact Privilege in that State issued to a PA through the procedures of this Compact. The PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a Compact Privilege based on having an unrestricted License in good standing from a Participating State.Section 2.

If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Participating States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact upon such State may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, and to the Licensing Board(s) of each of the Participating States.4. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.5.

Licensees who have been granted a Compact Privilege in that State shall retain the Compact Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of such termination.b. Licensees who are licensed in that State who have been granted a Compact Privilege in a Participating State shall retain the Compact Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) days unless the Licensee also has a Qualifying License in a Participating State or obtains a Qualifying License in a Participating State before the one hundred eighty (180)-day period ends, in which case the Compact Privilege shall continue.C. Dispute Resolution1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to this Compact that arise among Participating States and between participating and non-Participating States.2.

If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices, against a Participating State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and the Commission's promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.3.

If any Participating State later withdraws from the Compact or its participation is terminated, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Participating States should be less than seven. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Commission convening shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven initial Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.20250HB1961PN2470 - 32 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 3.

If any Licensee licensed in the withdrawing State is also licensed in another Participating State or obtains a license in another Participating State within the one hundred eighty (180) days, the Licensee's Compact Privileges in other Participating States shall not be affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty (180) days.2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the State Licensing Board(s) of the withdrawing State to comply with the investigative, and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior 20250HB1961PN2470 - 33 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 to the effective date of withdrawal.3.

PurposeIn order to strengthen access to Medical Services, and in 123456789101112131415161718 recognition of the advances in the delivery of Medical Services, the Participating States of the PA Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of State Licensing Boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a License to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of patients. This Compact allows Medical Services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the Licensee's Qualifying License by other Compact Participating States. This Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the State Licensing Board where the patient is located. State Licensing Boards that participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action against a Compact Privilege in that State issued to a PA through the procedures of this Compact. The PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a Compact Privilege based on having an unrestricted License in good standing from a Participating State.Section 2.

Designation of the State from Which Licensee is Applying for a Compact PrivilegeA. Upon a Licensee's application for a Compact Privilege, the Licensee shall identify to the Commission the Participating State from which the Licensee is applying, in accordance with applicable Rules adopted by the Commission, and subject to the following requirements:1. When applying for a Compact Privilege, the Licensee shall provide the Commission with the address of the Licensee's primary residence and thereafter shall immediately report to the Commission any change in the address of the Licensee's primary residence.2. When applying for a Compact Privilege, the Licensee is required to consent to accept service of process by mail at the Licensee's primary residence on file with the Commission with respect to any action brought against the Licensee by the Commission or a Participating State, including a subpoena, with respect to any action brought or investigation conducted by the Commission or a Participating State.Section 6.

Subpoenas issued by a Licensing Board in a Participating State for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another Participating State shall be enforced in the latter State by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the State in which the witnesses or evidence are located.3.

For purposes of taking Adverse Action, the Participating State which issued the Qualifying License shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from any other Participating State as it would if the conduct had occurred within the Participating State which issued the Qualifying License. In so doing, that Participating State shall apply its own State laws to determine appropriate action.D. A Participating State, if otherwise permitted by State law, may recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any Adverse Action taken against that PA.E. A Participating State may take Adverse Action based on the factual findings of a Remote State, provided that the Participating State follows its own procedures for taking the Adverse Action.F.

The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Participating State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State that establish the medical services a PA may perform in the Participating State, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.D.

Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or the Commission's Rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the Commission, this Compact, or Commission Rules. B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the Commission Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State and other Participating States. The notice shall 20250HB1961PN2470 - 28 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other action that the Commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Participating States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact upon such State may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, and to the Licensing Board(s) of each of the Participating States.4.
