The electric distribution company shall recover its costs from entering into the long-term resource adequacy agreement under clause (G).

An electric distribution company or the owner of the new generation resources under a long-term resource adequacy agreement shall credit to customers through a reconciliation of the nonbypassable cost-recovery tariff mechanism a portion of the net revenues received from offering resources associated with the new generation resources into wholesale markets.(H) The pretax return for the electric distribution company's capital investments in the new generation resources shall be calculated using the Federal and State income tax rates, the utility's actual capital structure and actual cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock as of the last day of the three-month period ending one month prior to the effective date of the surcharge mechanism established in accordance with clause (G) and any subsequent updates. The cost of equity shall be the 20250HB1272PN1425 - 8 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 equity return rate approved in the utility's most recent fully litigated base rate proceeding for which a final order was entered not more than two years prior to the effective date of the surcharge mechanism. If more than two years have elapsed between the entry of a final order and the effective date of the surcharge mechanism, the equity return rate used in the calculation shall be the equity return rate calculated by the commission in the most recent Quarterly Report on the Earnings of Jurisdictional Utilities released by the commission.(ii) This paragraph shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this title or other laws of this Commonwealth and shall specifically supersede all provisions of Chapter 28 (relating to restructuring of electric utility industry).* * *Section 3.
