3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 WHEREAS, The concerns and needs of the individuals who use these programs should be the foremost priority for legislators in delivering assistance to those individuals; therefore be itRESOLVED, That the House of Representatives direct the Joint State Government Commission to conduct a study and issue a report on the programs administered by the Office of Long-Term Living and the Office of Developmental Programs focused on how to improve the experience of individuals with disabilities that receive a Home and Community-Based Services waiver; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That the study:(1) Report on whether Home and Community-Based Services waivers meet the medical needs of recipients who have a disability, and ways in which care under waivers can be improved to better meet the medical needs of individuals with disabilities, taking into consideration those differences in the needs of individuals with physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, autism and other developmental disabilities.(2) Report on access to primary, secondary and tertiary prevention health care, medical supplies, nursing services, medically related supports such as tube feedings or catheter changing, and the social determinants of health for individuals with disabilities on Home and Community-Based Services waivers and whether the access adequately meets the needs of individuals with disabilities.(3) Report on the barriers and facilitators to hiring an attendant or direct care worker to be able to provide these supports when a nurse is not available under these waivers.(4) Examine challenges faced by waiver participants to 20250HR0134PN1045 -
