Title 27 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended by adding a chapter to read:CHAPTER 67PORTABLE BATTERY STEWARDSHIPSec.6701. Scope of chapter.6702. Legislative findings.6703.

Scope of chapter.This chapter relates to portable battery stewardship.ยง 6702. Legislative findings.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) It is in the public interest of the residents of this Commonwealth to encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, including metals, that replace the output of mining and other extractive industries.(2) Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist.(3) Ensuring the proper handling, recycling and end-of-life management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, including by igniting fires at solid-waste-handling facilities. For this reason, batteries should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or 20250HB1233PN1370 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 disposed of via traditional garbage collection containers.(4) Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by the end-of-life management of batteries.(5) It is difficult for customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries so it is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all battery types and chemistries.ยง 6703.

Title 27 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended by adding a chapter to read:CHAPTER 67PORTABLE BATTERY STEWARDSHIPSec.6701. Scope of chapter.6702. Legislative findings.6703.

Scope of chapter.This chapter relates to portable battery stewardship.ยง 6702. Legislative findings.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) It is in the public interest of the residents of this Commonwealth to encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, including metals, that replace the output of mining and other extractive industries.(2) Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist.(3) Ensuring the proper handling, recycling and end-of-life management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, including by igniting fires at solid-waste-handling facilities. For this reason, batteries should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or 20250HB1233PN1370 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 disposed of via traditional garbage collection containers.(4) Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by the end-of-life management of batteries.(5) It is difficult for customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries so it is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all battery types and chemistries.ยง 6703.
