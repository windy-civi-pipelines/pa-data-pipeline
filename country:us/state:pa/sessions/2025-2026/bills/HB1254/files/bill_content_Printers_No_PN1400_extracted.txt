Legislative findings and intent. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) All individuals have a qualified right to control their health care and should not lose that right if they 20250HB1254PN1400 - 12 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 become incompetent or have never been a competent adult.(2) The Commonwealth has recognized this right by providing for advance health care directives in which individuals may provide direction and state their goals and preferences about future health care and by providing for surrogate decision makers for incompetent adults and unemancipated minors.(3) Pennsylvania orders for life-sustaining treatment, or POLST, differs from an advance health care directive as it converts an individual's wishes regarding health care into a medical order that is immediately actionable and applicable across all health care settings.(4) The use of a POLST may overcome many of the limitations and problems associated with advance health care directives and existing orders regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other end-of-life care, including out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate orders.(5) In many cases, advance health care directives only name a surrogate decision maker to make health care decisions for the principal or lack specificity as to the principal's goals and preferences for a medical condition that subsequently develops because it was not foreseen by the principal.(6) Existing medical orders are frequently ineffective when the patient is transferred from one care setting to another because the procedures, forms and requirements at each care setting may be different, resulting in a loss in the ability of patients to have their wishes honored.(7) Existing emergency medical services protocols may require emergency medical services personnel to proceed to 20250HB1254PN1400 - 13 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 cardiopulmonary resuscitation when an individual is found in cardiac and respiratory arrest, even if the individual has completed an advance directive or has otherwise clearly indicated that the individual does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation.(8) A POLST, which is executed by a health care practitioner under appropriate circumstances to implement the wishes of the patient expressed directly by the patient or through a surrogate decision maker, provides clear direction for the patient's care regarding health care issues likely to emerge given the patient's current medical condition.(9) A key step in the POLST process is the health care practitioner's review with the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker of the patient's current health status, diagnoses and prognosis to determine whether a POLST would be appropriate or should be updated.(10) The POLST decision-making process and medical orders are intended for patients who are considered to be at risk for a life-threatening clinical event because they have a serious life-limiting medical condition, which may include advanced frailty.(11) Among vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, a POLST is appropriate for seriously ill or frail patients if their health care practitioner would not be surprised if they died within the next year.(12) A POLST is not recommended for individuals with stable, even chronic, medical conditions with years of life expectancy.(13) It should not be assumed that all patients in any facility, including a nursing home, should have or would 20250HB1254PN1400 - 14 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 desire a POLST.(14) The well-being of the patient is paramount in considering a POLST, not cost savings to the government or insurers.(15) A POLST is appropriately entered following a shared decision-making process that facilitates patient consent that is voluntary, educated, collaborative and thoughtful, including a discussion of the patient's current clinical status, treatment options and likely outcomes, together with the patient's goals of care, preferences and values.(16) Conversations about a POLST must avoid any bias against continuation of care and must not characterize the continuation of life as burdensome. When appropriate, these conversations should emphasize palliative care and hospice availability.(17) A standardized POLST form, which is easily recognized, understood and implemented, can greatly advance the ability of patients to ensure that their medical care is aligned with their goals of care, preferences and values, as informed by a shared decision-making process.(18) Advance health care directives remain critically important for adults from the age of majority until death. An advance health care directive, rather than a POLST, is the appropriate advance care planning tool for healthy patients.(19) When the use of a POLST becomes appropriate, an existing advance health care directive will help shape the choices of the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker when discussing a POLST with a health care provider. (20) This subchapter is intended to provide a framework and legal authority for a POLST to be valid and portable 20250HB1254PN1400 - 15 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 across all care settings, consistent with the foregoing findings.§ 5493.

Legislative findings and intent. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) All individuals have a qualified right to control their health care and should not lose that right if they 20250HB1254PN1400 - 12 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 become incompetent or have never been a competent adult.(2) The Commonwealth has recognized this right by providing for advance health care directives in which individuals may provide direction and state their goals and preferences about future health care and by providing for surrogate decision makers for incompetent adults and unemancipated minors.(3) Pennsylvania orders for life-sustaining treatment, or POLST, differs from an advance health care directive as it converts an individual's wishes regarding health care into a medical order that is immediately actionable and applicable across all health care settings.(4) The use of a POLST may overcome many of the limitations and problems associated with advance health care directives and existing orders regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other end-of-life care, including out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate orders.(5) In many cases, advance health care directives only name a surrogate decision maker to make health care decisions for the principal or lack specificity as to the principal's goals and preferences for a medical condition that subsequently develops because it was not foreseen by the principal.(6) Existing medical orders are frequently ineffective when the patient is transferred from one care setting to another because the procedures, forms and requirements at each care setting may be different, resulting in a loss in the ability of patients to have their wishes honored.(7) Existing emergency medical services protocols may require emergency medical services personnel to proceed to 20250HB1254PN1400 - 13 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 cardiopulmonary resuscitation when an individual is found in cardiac and respiratory arrest, even if the individual has completed an advance directive or has otherwise clearly indicated that the individual does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation.(8) A POLST, which is executed by a health care practitioner under appropriate circumstances to implement the wishes of the patient expressed directly by the patient or through a surrogate decision maker, provides clear direction for the patient's care regarding health care issues likely to emerge given the patient's current medical condition.(9) A key step in the POLST process is the health care practitioner's review with the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker of the patient's current health status, diagnoses and prognosis to determine whether a POLST would be appropriate or should be updated.(10) The POLST decision-making process and medical orders are intended for patients who are considered to be at risk for a life-threatening clinical event because they have a serious life-limiting medical condition, which may include advanced frailty.(11) Among vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, a POLST is appropriate for seriously ill or frail patients if their health care practitioner would not be surprised if they died within the next year.(12) A POLST is not recommended for individuals with stable, even chronic, medical conditions with years of life expectancy.(13) It should not be assumed that all patients in any facility, including a nursing home, should have or would 20250HB1254PN1400 - 14 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 desire a POLST.(14) The well-being of the patient is paramount in considering a POLST, not cost savings to the government or insurers.(15) A POLST is appropriately entered following a shared decision-making process that facilitates patient consent that is voluntary, educated, collaborative and thoughtful, including a discussion of the patient's current clinical status, treatment options and likely outcomes, together with the patient's goals of care, preferences and values.(16) Conversations about a POLST must avoid any bias against continuation of care and must not characterize the continuation of life as burdensome. When appropriate, these conversations should emphasize palliative care and hospice availability.(17) A standardized POLST form, which is easily recognized, understood and implemented, can greatly advance the ability of patients to ensure that their medical care is aligned with their goals of care, preferences and values, as informed by a shared decision-making process.(18) Advance health care directives remain critically important for adults from the age of majority until death. An advance health care directive, rather than a POLST, is the appropriate advance care planning tool for healthy patients.(19) When the use of a POLST becomes appropriate, an existing advance health care directive will help shape the choices of the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker when discussing a POLST with a health care provider. (20) This subchapter is intended to provide a framework and legal authority for a POLST to be valid and portable 20250HB1254PN1400 - 15 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 across all care settings, consistent with the foregoing findings.§ 5493.
