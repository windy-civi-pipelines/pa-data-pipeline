In any case in which the taxable year for which an underpayment of estimated tax may exist is a short taxable year, in determining the tax shown on the report or the total tax for the safe harbor base year, the tax will be reduced by multiplying it by the ratio of the number of installment payments made in the short taxable year to the number of installment payments required to be made for the full taxable year.(d.1) With respect to any underpayment of an installment of estimated corporate net income tax for any tax year that begins in taxable year 2025 or 2026 by a corporation required to file a combined annual report pursuant to section 403(a.1)(1), interest shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of 20250SB0656PN0695 - 16 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 estimated corporate net income tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment equals or exceeds the amount which would have been required to be paid on or before such date if the estimated tax were an amount equal to the combined tax shown on the reports of all the members of the unitary business for the safe harbor base year computed at the rate applicable to the taxable year.Section 5.

Underpayment of Estimated Tax.--* * *(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of [the preceding subsections,] this section, other than as set forth in subsection (d.1), interest with respect to any underpayment of any installment of estimated tax shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment equals or exceeds the amount which would have been required to be paid on or before such date if the estimated tax were an amount equal to the tax computed at the rates applicable to the taxable year, including any minimum tax imposed, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the report of the taxpayer for, and the law applicable to, the safe harbor base year, adjusted for any changes to sections 401, 601, 602 and 1101 enacted for the taxable year, if a report showing a liability for tax was filed by the taxpayer for the safe harbor base year. If the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment does not equal or exceed the amount required to be 20250SB0656PN0695 - 15 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 paid per the preceding sentence, but such amount is paid after the date the installment was required to be paid, then the period of underpayment shall run from the date the installment was required to be paid to the date the amount required to be paid per the preceding sentence is paid.

In any case in which the taxable year for which an underpayment of estimated tax may exist is a short taxable year, in determining the tax shown on the report or the total tax for the safe harbor base year, the tax will be reduced by multiplying it by the ratio of the number of installment payments made in the short taxable year to the number of installment payments required to be made for the full taxable year.(d.1) With respect to any underpayment of an installment of estimated corporate net income tax for any tax year that begins in taxable year 2025 or 2026 by a corporation required to file a combined annual report pursuant to section 403(a.1)(1), interest shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of 20250SB0656PN0695 - 16 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 estimated corporate net income tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment equals or exceeds the amount which would have been required to be paid on or before such date if the estimated tax were an amount equal to the combined tax shown on the reports of all the members of the unitary business for the safe harbor base year computed at the rate applicable to the taxable year.Section 5.
