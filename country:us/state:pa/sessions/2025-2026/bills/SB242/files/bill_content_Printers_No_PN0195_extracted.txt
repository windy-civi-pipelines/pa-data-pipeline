Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Right-to-Bear-Arms Protection Act.Section 2.

Section 25 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania also clearly and unambiguously states that "to guard against transgressions of the high powers which we have delegated, we 12345678910111213141516171819 declare that everything in this article is excepted out of the general powers of government and shall forever remain inviolate," and further finds that both of these are rights of "The People," which are clearly laid out prior to any mention of the framework of government having been defined in the Constitution of Pennsylvania.(2) The right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right possessed by the individual necessary for defense of self and preservation of liberty and shall not be infringed.(3) It is the intent of the General Assembly to protect State actors from being directed through Federal action to violate their oath of defense and preservation of these individual rights as enumerated in the Constitution of the United States and section 21 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania of its residents' right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State.(4) Pursuant to and in furtherance of the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, the Federal Government may not commandeer this State's actors to participate in the enforcement or facilitation of any Federal action or regulatory program.(5) This right to be free from the commandeering hand of the Federal Government has been most notably recognized by the United States Supreme Court in Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), when the Court held: "The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program."(6) The anticommandeering principles recognized by the 20250SB0242PN0195 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Supreme Court in Printz v.

Any of the following issued or enacted by the Federal Government:(1) An executive order.(2) An agency order.(3) A statute.(4) A law.(5) A rule.(6) A regulation.(7) An arbitrary clarification or classification, including any of the following:(i) A classification of weapons based on attributes that do not go to a primary combustion function of the firearm, such as natural unmodified rate of fire.(ii) A classification designed to prohibit possession for nonmechanically necessary attributes, such as bayonet lugs, telescoping stocks, muzzle breaks or other fixtures, pistol grips and pistol braces.(iii) A clarification issued through executive or legislative agencies designed to prohibit ownership or possession of firearms based on attributes that are nonmechanically necessary or in common use.20250SB0242PN0195 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 "Firearm accessory."
