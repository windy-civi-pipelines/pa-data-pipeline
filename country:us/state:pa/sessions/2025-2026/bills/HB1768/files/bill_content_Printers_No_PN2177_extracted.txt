Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Keystone Fresh Act.Section 2. Findings and declarations.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) Schools across Pennsylvania serve more than 168 million lunches per year, providing critical nutrients to children across this Commonwealth. Due to the large volume of food purchased to support nutrition programs, schools have the potential to be one of the largest markets for 123456789101112131415161718 agricultural producers across this Commonwealth. Farm to School programs encourage schools to purchase, promote and serve local foods. Nationally, Farm to School programs have shown to be an innovative strategy to improve child nutrition, with research indicating students eat 37% more vegetables and 11% more fruit. Pennsylvania has a long history of interest in Farm to School programs, with 268 districts (44%) currently participating in some level of farm-to-school activity. According to the United States Department of Agriculture's 2023 Farm to School Census, more than 71% of Pennsylvania's schools reported purchasing some Pennsylvania products, yet those local food sales, excluding liquid milk, were only 9% of their total lunch program budget.(2) The purpose of this program is to meet Statewide interest in increasing the amount of local food served in school meals by helping to change school food procurement practices, provide technical assistance and training for how to integrate local foods in school meals and help Pennsylvania producers access the school food market.(3) Enacting the Keystone Fresh Act will provide State-level investment to expand farm-to-school efforts and provide economic, public health and community benefits for Pennsylvanians.Section 3.
