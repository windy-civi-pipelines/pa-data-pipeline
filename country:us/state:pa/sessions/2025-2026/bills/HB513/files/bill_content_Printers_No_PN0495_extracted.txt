2025-2026 Regular Session HB 513 PN 0495 Bill Text (HTM) See other bills under thesame topic PRINTER'S NO. 495 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIAHOUSE BILL No.513 Session of 2025 INTRODUCED BY DAVANZO AND JAMES, FEBRUARY 5, 2025 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS AND OPERATIONS, FEBRUARY 5, 2025 AN ACTProviding for Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System, for notation requirements and for duties of State Geospatial Coordinating Board; and making a repeal.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:Section 1. Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System Act.Section 2. Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System.(a) System.--The most recent system of plane coordinates based on the National Spatial Reference System, known as the State Plane Coordinate System, which has been established by the National Geodetic Survey or its successors for defining and stating the horizontal positions or locations of points on the surface of the earth within this Commonwealth, shall be known as the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System.(b) Parameters.--The defining parameters of the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System, including zone definitions, shall 123456789101112131415161718 be defined and published by the National Geodetic Survey or its successors as a part of the overall State Plane Coordinate System. The defining parameters may be requested to be changed by the State Geospatial Coordinating Board or the Department of Transportation or the successors or designees of the State Geospatial Coordinating Board or the Department of Transportation.(c) Geodetic datums.--The official geodetic datums to which geodetic coordinates, including, but not limited to, latitude, longitude, ellipsoid height, orthometric height or dynamic height, are referenced within this Commonwealth shall be as defined for the National Spatial Reference System or its successors and may be accessed via the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Continuously Operating Reference Stations Network.(d) Previous versions.--Previous versions of the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System shall include the Pennsylvania Coordinate System of 1927 and the Pennsylvania Coordinate System of 1983 as specified by the act of June 2, 1937 (P.L.1208, No.310), entitled "An act to describe, define, and officially adopt a system of coordinates for designating the positions of points on the surface of the earth within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."Section 3. Description of Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System.The Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System shall consist of two layers of zones as follows:(1) a single zone with full coverage of this Commonwealth; and(2) a set of smaller regional zones, as specified under 20250HB0513PN0495 - 2 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 section 5, that together provide the same coverage as specified under paragraph (1).Section 4. Use of layers and zones.(a) Uses.--The layer specified under section 3(1) is designed for Statewide geospatial datasets. The layer specified under section 3(2) is designed for engineering or surveying projects.(b) Determination.--The determination of which layer and zone to use shall be a user decision based on individual and specific needs.Section 5. Regional zones.For use of the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System, this Commonwealth shall be divided into smaller regional zones as established by the National Geodetic Survey or its successors as specified under section 2(b).Section 6. Coordinates and distances.(a) Coordinates.--The plane coordinates of a point on the surface of the earth, to be used for expressing the geographic position or location of the point in the appropriate zone of the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System, shall consist of two distances expressed in meters and decimals of a meter or International Feet and decimals of a foot.(b) Distances.--(1) One of the distances specified in subsection (a), which shall be known as the "east or x-coordinate," shall give the distance east of the y-axis. The other distance specified under subsection (a), which shall be known as the "north or y-coordinate," shall give the distance north of the x-axis.(2) The y-axis of any zone shall be parallel with the 20250HB0513PN0495 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 central meridian of that zone.(3) The x-axis of any zone shall be at right angles to the central meridian of that zone.(4) An International Foot, which equals 0.3048 meters exactly, shall be used for all foot distances and coordinates unless the distances or coordinates are tied to one of the previous versions of the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System specified under section 2(d).(5) The U.S. Survey Foot, which equals 1200/3937 meters exactly or 0.3048006 meters approximately, shall be superseded by the International Foot as specified under paragraph (4) as determined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.Section 7. Notation requirements.All of the following shall be named in any land description, plat, map, report of survey or other document in which coordinates based on the Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System are used:(1) The Pennsylvania State Plane Coordinate System.(2) The name of the zone, either Statewide or regional, as established by the National Geodetic Survey or its successors in accordance with section 2(b).(3) The source geodetic datum and decimal-year epoch date of the survey or coordinate derivation or calculation.Section 8. Duties of State Geospatial Coordinating Board.The State Geospatial Coordinating Board shall transmit a notice to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the next available issue of the Pennsylvania Bulletin upon the release of the State Plane Coordinate System 2022 by the National Geodetic Survey or its successors.20250HB0513PN0495 - 4 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Section 9. Construction.Nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the appropriate use of other datums and other geodetic reference networks.Section 10. Repeals.The act of June 2, 1937 (P.L.1208, No.310), entitled "An act to describe, define, and officially adopt a system of coordinates for designating the positions of points on the surface of the earth within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania," is repealed insofar as it is inconsistent with this act.Section 11. Effective date.This act shall take effect as follows:(1) The following shall take effect immediately:Section 8.This section.(2) The remainder of this act shall take effect upon publication of the notice under section 8.20250HB0513PN0495 - 5 - 1234567891011121314151617
