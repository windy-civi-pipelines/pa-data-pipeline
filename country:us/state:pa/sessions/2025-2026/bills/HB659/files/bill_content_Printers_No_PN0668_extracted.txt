Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Integrated Water Resources Restoration, Protection and Management Act.Section 102. Legislative findings.The General Assembly finds that:(1) Inadequate management of storm water runoff and the insufficient planning, coordination and integration of regulatory programs associated with water resources management activities cause increased flood flows and velocities, contribute to accelerated erosion and sedimentation, overtax the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increase the cost of public facilities to carry and control storm water and wastewater, undermine 20250HB0659PN0668 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduce groundwater recharge, diminish the quality and quantity of water supplies and threaten the environment, public health, safety and property.(2) The Storm Water Management Act is not sufficiently comprehensive to address the needs of this Commonwealth. While the act provides a basis for storm water management planning by counties on a watershed basis, additional provisions are needed in addition to the Storm Water Management Act requirements to provide integrated and thorough planning and management of water resources in watershed-based planning areas and to address current and past water resources management problems, as well as prospective and ongoing development.(3) A comprehensive, integrated approach to water resources management, building on the protections established under The Clean Streams Law, including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing adverse impacts to waters of this Commonwealth, is fundamental to public health, safety and welfare and protection of the residents of this Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.(4) Adequate management of this Commonwealth's water resources requires additional legal mechanisms for coordination and integration of water resources management planning among State agencies and county and municipal governments.(5) Dedicated funding is needed to develop and implement integrated water resources management plans to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore this Commonwealth's water resources and the environment and to protect public health, 20250HB0659PN0668 - 4 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 safety and property.Section 103. Purposes.The purposes of this act are to:(1) Provide for more comprehensive storm water planning and management, building on the framework found in the Storm Water Management Act, and implementing The Clean Streams Law, to authorize planning for and remediation of storm-water-associated problems and integrating related water resources management programs.(2) Restore, reclaim, protect and maintain the water quality, quantity and natural hydrologic regime.(3) Regulate and, as appropriate, restrict development in the floodways and floodplains of this Commonwealth's rivers and streams.(4) Preserve the carrying capacity of watercourses.(5) Protect, maintain, reclaim and restore surface waters and groundwaters of this Commonwealth.(6) Protect the natural resources, environmental rights and values secured by the Constitution of Pennsylvania.(7) Authorize counties to undertake and enforce comprehensive, ecologically sustainable and consistent water resources management planning.(8) Consolidate and coordinate governmental resources.(9) Establish a dedicated, stable and tailored funding source.(10) Authorize municipalities or water resources management to undertake the activities under paragraph (7) if a county does not elect to undertake the integrated water resources planning or management.(11) Encourage the regional implementation of integrated 20250HB0659PN0668 - 5 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 water resources management plans within watershed-based planning areas to preserve and protect watershed-based planning areas from the adverse effects of fragmented planning related to water resources protection, water infrastructure, wet weather and wastewater management, storm water runoff and subsurface drainage.(12) Authorize the creation of water resources management authorities to enable counties and municipalities to regulate, manage, operate and maintain activities, facilities and development that may affect storm water runoff or water resources within watershed-based planning areas.(13) Regulate, implement and manage comprehensive storm water management plans or integrated water resources management plans within watershed-based planning areas.(14) Undertake the planning related to the activities under paragraphs (12) and (13) as appropriate.(15) Encourage water resources management authorities to utilize a comprehensive integrated water resources approach for water resources protection, maintenance and improvement, including quantity and quality, and other environmental benefits.(16) Authorize dedicated funding to develop and implement updated, expanded and comprehensive storm water planning and management, as well as to develop and implement integrated water resources management plans to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore this Commonwealth's water resources and to protect public health, safety, property and the environment.Section 104.

Short title.This act shall be known and may be cited as the Integrated Water Resources Restoration, Protection and Management Act.Section 102. Legislative findings.The General Assembly finds that:(1) Inadequate management of storm water runoff and the insufficient planning, coordination and integration of regulatory programs associated with water resources management activities cause increased flood flows and velocities, contribute to accelerated erosion and sedimentation, overtax the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increase the cost of public facilities to carry and control storm water and wastewater, undermine 20250HB0659PN0668 - 3 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduce groundwater recharge, diminish the quality and quantity of water supplies and threaten the environment, public health, safety and property.(2) The Storm Water Management Act is not sufficiently comprehensive to address the needs of this Commonwealth. While the act provides a basis for storm water management planning by counties on a watershed basis, additional provisions are needed in addition to the Storm Water Management Act requirements to provide integrated and thorough planning and management of water resources in watershed-based planning areas and to address current and past water resources management problems, as well as prospective and ongoing development.(3) A comprehensive, integrated approach to water resources management, building on the protections established under The Clean Streams Law, including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing adverse impacts to waters of this Commonwealth, is fundamental to public health, safety and welfare and protection of the residents of this Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.(4) Adequate management of this Commonwealth's water resources requires additional legal mechanisms for coordination and integration of water resources management planning among State agencies and county and municipal governments.(5) Dedicated funding is needed to develop and implement integrated water resources management plans to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore this Commonwealth's water resources and the environment and to protect public health, 20250HB0659PN0668 - 4 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 safety and property.Section 103. Purposes.The purposes of this act are to:(1) Provide for more comprehensive storm water planning and management, building on the framework found in the Storm Water Management Act, and implementing The Clean Streams Law, to authorize planning for and remediation of storm-water-associated problems and integrating related water resources management programs.(2) Restore, reclaim, protect and maintain the water quality, quantity and natural hydrologic regime.(3) Regulate and, as appropriate, restrict development in the floodways and floodplains of this Commonwealth's rivers and streams.(4) Preserve the carrying capacity of watercourses.(5) Protect, maintain, reclaim and restore surface waters and groundwaters of this Commonwealth.(6) Protect the natural resources, environmental rights and values secured by the Constitution of Pennsylvania.(7) Authorize counties to undertake and enforce comprehensive, ecologically sustainable and consistent water resources management planning.(8) Consolidate and coordinate governmental resources.(9) Establish a dedicated, stable and tailored funding source.(10) Authorize municipalities or water resources management to undertake the activities under paragraph (7) if a county does not elect to undertake the integrated water resources planning or management.(11) Encourage the regional implementation of integrated 20250HB0659PN0668 - 5 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 water resources management plans within watershed-based planning areas to preserve and protect watershed-based planning areas from the adverse effects of fragmented planning related to water resources protection, water infrastructure, wet weather and wastewater management, storm water runoff and subsurface drainage.(12) Authorize the creation of water resources management authorities to enable counties and municipalities to regulate, manage, operate and maintain activities, facilities and development that may affect storm water runoff or water resources within watershed-based planning areas.(13) Regulate, implement and manage comprehensive storm water management plans or integrated water resources management plans within watershed-based planning areas.(14) Undertake the planning related to the activities under paragraphs (12) and (13) as appropriate.(15) Encourage water resources management authorities to utilize a comprehensive integrated water resources approach for water resources protection, maintenance and improvement, including quantity and quality, and other environmental benefits.(16) Authorize dedicated funding to develop and implement updated, expanded and comprehensive storm water planning and management, as well as to develop and implement integrated water resources management plans to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore this Commonwealth's water resources and to protect public health, safety, property and the environment.Section 104.
