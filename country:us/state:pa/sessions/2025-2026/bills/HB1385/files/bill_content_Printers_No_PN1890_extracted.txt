Under no circumstances shall a manifestation of disability serve as grounds for a probation violation, technical violation or a finding of failure to adjust. The following shall apply:(i) In cases where a child with a disability's behavior in an out-of-home placement forms a part of an allegation of a probation violation, technical violation or a failure to adjust, the court shall conduct a manifestation determination review with the child and the child's parents or guardians to determine whether the behavior in question reflected a manifestation of the child's disability. At a minimum, the court shall review all of the following:(A) The current or most recent individualized education plan, 504 plan, functional behavioral assessment or positive behavioral support plan.(B) Teacher observations, therapist recommendations and most recent assessments.20250HB1385PN1890 - 12 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (C) Related information as to whether the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability.(D) Related information as to whether the conduct in question was the direct result of the failure to implement a current individualized education plan, 504 plan or any recommended therapeutic support or reasonable extension of therapeutic support.(ii) If the court determines that the conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability, the court shall:(A) return the child to the placement with proper supports, transfer the child without support to a more appropriate placement if the child agrees or return the child to the child's home; and(B) order a functional behavioral assessment, unless a functional behavioral assessment had occurred before the behavior in question and a behavioral intervention plan for the child was implemented; or(C) review the behavioral intervention plan and modify it, as necessary, to address the behavior.(4) Nothing in this subsection is intended to alter or limit related rights under Federal or State law or to limit consideration of matters in any aspect of the dependency or delinquency systems.* * *(c) Required statement of reasons.--Prior to entering an order of disposition under subsection (a), the court shall state 20250HB1385PN1890 - 13 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 its disposition and the reasons for its disposition on the record in open court, together with the goals, terms and conditions of that disposition. If the child is to be committed to out-of-home placement, the court shall also state the name of the specific facility or type of facility to which the child will be committed and its findings and conclusions of law that formed the basis of its decision consistent with subsection (a) and section 6301, including the reasons why commitment to that facility or type of facility was determined to be the least restrictive placement that is consistent with the protection of the public and best suited to the child's treatment, supervision, rehabilitation and welfare. The following shall apply:(1) Prior to entering an order committing a child with an individualized education plan or 504 plan to an out-of-home placement, the court shall make an independent determination on the record if the child will be provided a free appropriate public education while in the placement, including receiving services specified in the child's current individualized education plan or 504 plan.(2) If a child's individualized education plan or 504 plan cannot be implemented, followed or measured to provide a free and appropriate public education as required under 20 U.S.C.

No child who has the ability to pay shall be ordered to pay a monthly installment amount greater than five hours of minimum wage of this Commonwealth.(3) At each post-disposition review proceeding, the court shall make findings of the progress a child has made toward satisfying the order for restitution and shall inquire as to the assistance given to the child by the probation department and placement providers. A child shall have at least one review hearing every four months. The court may 20250HB1385PN1890 - 15 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 schedule a review hearing at any time or upon motion of a parent or legal guardian.(4) The court may modify the order for restitution at a post-disposition review proceeding, provided the victim has an opportunity to object by receiving notice of the hearing.(5) If a child has satisfied all conditions of supervision other than payment of restitution in full, the court shall enter an order for termination of supervision, provided the victim has an opportunity to object by receiving notice of the hearing. The court shall make findings on the record with regard to the reason for the termination of supervision and forgiveness of outstanding restitution. The court shall not index a civil judgment against the child. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to preclude a victim from pursuing civil judgments against a responsible party.(c.2) Educational stability.--(1) An order resulting in the removal of a child from the child's home or a change in placement shall address the educational stability of the child.(2) A child removed from home shall remain in the child's school of origin unless the court finds that remaining in the school of origin is not in the child's best interest or protection of the community. If the court finds that it is not in the best interest for the child or protection of the community to remain in the school of origin, then the court may order the child to be enrolled in another school that best meets the child's needs.(3) If the court orders a child with a disability to be enrolled in another school, the best interest determination 20250HB1385PN1890 - 16 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 shall include a finding on the record that the school is willing and able to provide a free and appropriate public education under 20 U.S.C. Ch. 33 to the child, including following, monitoring and measuring individualized education plan goals.(4) If a court orders a child to be enrolled in another school under paragraph (2), the child shall attend a public school unless the court finds that a public school is not in the best interest of the child or protection of the community.(c.3) Employment in placement.--A child employed by the placement shall not be paid less than the minimum wage under section 4 of the act of January 17, 1968 (P.L.11, No.5), known as The Minimum Wage Act of 1968.* * *Section 3.

Under no circumstances shall a manifestation of disability serve as grounds for a probation violation, technical violation or a finding of failure to adjust. The following shall apply:(i) In cases where a child with a disability's behavior in an out-of-home placement forms a part of an allegation of a probation violation, technical violation or a failure to adjust, the court shall conduct a manifestation determination review with the child and the child's parents or guardians to determine whether the behavior in question reflected a manifestation of the child's disability. At a minimum, the court shall review all of the following:(A) The current or most recent individualized education plan, 504 plan, functional behavioral assessment or positive behavioral support plan.(B) Teacher observations, therapist recommendations and most recent assessments.20250HB1385PN1890 - 12 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 (C) Related information as to whether the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability.(D) Related information as to whether the conduct in question was the direct result of the failure to implement a current individualized education plan, 504 plan or any recommended therapeutic support or reasonable extension of therapeutic support.(ii) If the court determines that the conduct was a manifestation of the child's disability, the court shall:(A) return the child to the placement with proper supports, transfer the child without support to a more appropriate placement if the child agrees or return the child to the child's home; and(B) order a functional behavioral assessment, unless a functional behavioral assessment had occurred before the behavior in question and a behavioral intervention plan for the child was implemented; or(C) review the behavioral intervention plan and modify it, as necessary, to address the behavior.(4) Nothing in this subsection is intended to alter or limit related rights under Federal or State law or to limit consideration of matters in any aspect of the dependency or delinquency systems.* * *(c) Required statement of reasons.--Prior to entering an order of disposition under subsection (a), the court shall state 20250HB1385PN1890 - 13 - 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 its disposition and the reasons for its disposition on the record in open court, together with the goals, terms and conditions of that disposition. If the child is to be committed to out-of-home placement, the court shall also state the name of the specific facility or type of facility to which the child will be committed and its findings and conclusions of law that formed the basis of its decision consistent with subsection (a) and section 6301, including the reasons why commitment to that facility or type of facility was determined to be the least restrictive placement that is consistent with the protection of the public and best suited to the child's treatment, supervision, rehabilitation and welfare.
